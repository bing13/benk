             14:55 &lt;bing13&gt; She would love someone to do the the AORN launch, she says they'll be a big pain (no thanks!). There is also an INFORMS launch in March she would like help with.

             14:58 &lt;bing13&gt; Also, she said GSW (they journals) is going to require considerably more than the statutory 2wk follow up, owing to the fact they're taking post-launch feedback from all their societies.

  Interested parties:

  5 publishers or so
  <br />
  + Sage and OUP are tracking
  <br />
  + PNAS
  <br />
  + BMJ
  <br />
  <br />
  Sage wants a sponsorship business mode

  <br />
  micro has no a/c, few pages, one main content page;&nbsp; up to three total
  <br />
  (you don't consume micro )
  <br />
  <br />
  mini (not much demand), can have content, more a/c, features like video (you consume content on a mini) pod cast, image categoreis
  <br />
  <br />
  Matt has an &quot;order form&quot; to get things as preset as possible
  <br />
  <br />
  Matt is not convinced we haven't spec'ed a PjM.
  <br />
  <br />
  BH: THis doesn't seem to fit
  <br />
  <br />
  1 publisher = 4 or 8 hours.
  <br />
  <br />
  ========================
  <br />
  <br />
  Each order form will be unique
  <br />
  MR wants a image gallery of site styles
  <br />
  Customers will fill out an initital order form (structured, detailed), and then the project manager will generate a custom order form that they send to the customer to fill out.

  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  If they want custom, then it's macro...

  Viswa: spec due for jbjs-br phase 2 this month. We might not be able to get to all of it in Q1.
  <br />
  <br />

  <br />
  JS: The competition is going in and doing demos with our data. We have to be able to do that!

  MR: Mobile ad service - now the Ammo (?) ad service alrmost ready. For those who want to do their own, we'll point them at Google, etc. Thrid part would be further in the future.
  <br />
  <br />
  ============
  <br />
  <br />
  Q2
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ: &quot;Shopping cart&quot; should probably replace PPV
  <br />
  <br />
  ==
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ: Microtagging - we're really dependent upon the standards org / google to fess up
  <br />
  <br />
  ===
  <br />
  <br />
  TM:&nbsp; Directors want us to develop a standard drupal-based site that will be used for all new sites. (!)&nbsp; Templated sites.
  <br />
  AB: more from steering committee
  <br />
  CJ: Investigation and trial!&nbsp; it's nto a demo. We need to figure out how to do it, and do one.
  <br />
  TM: has asked by Helen Sz if we can launch standard sites for
  <b>
   <font>

  <font>
   June in drupal.
   <br />
   <br />
   ==

   JS: productize anything from JBJS-BR ph1 or ph2? Or aap Portal2015
   <br />
   <br />
   ==
   <br />
   JS: Linked open data. Keller clearly expects us sto have something cooking there. Phil Schurr is. He wants data interfaces, etc. Better be on Road Map.
   <br />
   CJ: MK stuff is loosely specified right now.
   <br />
   <br />
   ====
   <br />
   <br />
   CJ: this quarter, we publish smpte standards as pure h20 book
   <br />
   In Q1, we look at aptabooks, erm, etc., and see what it woudl take to publish those in common, non-interleaved workflow
   <br />
   <br />
   For Q2, we have two choices.&nbsp; Can either continue on content publisher path, and get pure h2O publishing [a lot of work and risk]
   <br />
   OR, we can look at runtime dependencies on H1O (legacy H1O sites, services) i.e., the services,&nbsp;&nbsp; Shut down H1o sites. Still need Content db. Start turning off the Solaris machines, and get rid of HW Maint.
   <br />
   400 items of dependence on H2O.&nbsp; By end of Q2, all maint functionalities will be in by end of Q2. Leverages SOA.&nbsp; Leverages what's needed for Drupal, etc. Existing h2O sites will be refitted as well. Improves stability, lets us shut down 1500 applications.
   <br />
   <br />
   ===========
   <br />
   <br />
   TM: need a sane way of adding new data types for data supplements. Publisher e-mail, etc.&nbsp; Jeff O sends mail, 5 or 6 peopel or do their one thing, then we redeploy site, THEN they can add their new data type.
   <br />
   <br />
   CJ: we need a whole need content management tool for this stuff. DSM is yuckie.
   <br />
   Needs interface to HWX.
   <br />
   Need product to support ex. foreign language abstracts loading into the content db, not as data supp's. This is much easier in H2O store, but the product needs to be built.
   <br />
   <br />
   =============
   <br />
   <br />
   LP: { on access control APIs for RUP, need them for mobile app???}
   <br />
   TR: I need to know about this for BMJ trip Dec 2.
   <br />
   <br />
   LP: CSHL wants a drupal standard site.
   <br />
   <br />
   LP: PNAS, CSHL both do lots of data supplements, we need to improve over next couple of quarters.
   <br />
   <br />
   ===
   <br />
   <br />
   KH: HWX emerging road map. Will include giving customer ability to delete articles, do some other substantial actions they can't go now.
   <br />
   <br />
   ==
   <br />
   <br />
   AAP 2015, JBJSBR&lt; ASCO, all want us to integrate content from other sources. OUP went to iFactory to do books and Journals. We need an offering.
   <br />
   <br />
   ==
   <br />
   <br />
   Q3: m-sites are ok now. Would like to build &quot;community&quot; features for m-sites.
   <br />
   Q1-Q#: mobile version of umbrella sites.&nbsp; Mobile-specific pages
   <br />
   ===========
   <br />
   <br />
   Qx: CJ as we shut down H1O, move from Sybase to Oracle, we can als osimplify how we do development and host sites. Modernize.
   <br />
   <br />
   KH: Image processing needs work, too.
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
   TM: we should look into replacing FAST&gt;
   <br />
   CJ: Solr/Lucene coming in via several paths.
   <br />
   TM: Ex., like federated search.
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
   CJ: Alerts 1.5 will need to go to Alerts 2.0, which needs a spec. We should
   <b>
    <font>
     partner with someone else.

   </b>
   <font>

      I totally agree.

    </b>
    <font>
     Direct marketing firms w/good tools.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use their tools,
     <br />
     <br />
     LP: File Manager, needs embargoing.
     <br />
     <br />
     ========
     <br />
     <br />
     TM: Rule of thumb is Road Map shouldn't be more than 60% of our staff's capability.
     <br />
     <br />
     MC: We need a POR, planning of CRs, deployments,&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, we don't have a Plan of Record.
     <br />
     <br />
     ========================
     <br />
     <br />
     AB: a manager will be assigned to each, and then the manager will get resources assign, and report shortages.

   So I've put some more time in on staffing for the new year.&nbsp; I've been

   The &quot;must assign&quot; section and the summary table, showing how booked
   <br />
   people are, is of most interest.
   <br />
   <br />
   I also did another scratch pad calcuation tab on
   <br />
   <br />

   <br />
   see the &quot;est 2&quot; tab.&nbsp; The&nbsp; &quot;FREE&quot; row and the&nbsp; &quot;must assign&quot; row are the
   <br />
   most interesting bits here.&nbsp; (Your % reflects the present OUP book load.)
   <br />
   <br />
   Here's the latest developments, plus my thought experiment for this
   <br />
   evening, I'd like your input, including full reality check.
   <br />
   <br />
   1. Phac and Dom both think JBJS-BR part 2 is at least 50% of a person.
   <br />
   I've upped it to that, with minor reservations.&nbsp; Phac has indicated he
   <br />
   would be willing to continue to work for HW @ 50%, perhaps 2 days a
   <br />
   week, or something like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not clear if Ron can get the funds, but
   <br />
   he's willing to try. I think the continuity on this extremely complex
   <br />
   project is work a lot.
   <br />
   <br />
   2. Especially if Ron wants to keep Phac on part time, we'll be losing
   <br />
   another PjM contractor.
   <br />
   <br />
   3. I don't fully understand what the OUP books decision means for your
   <br />
   schedule, starting when. Do&nbsp; you? Let's discuss tomorrow on our call. In
   <br />
   my sketch this evening, I gave you the Ed Book (AACR), Red Book (AAP),
   <br />
   and SAP Book (ASH). Is that a fair exchange for OUP? Not sure about
   <br />
   &quot;phasing out&quot;&nbsp; for OUP, etc. [Did you faint?]
   <br />
   <br />
   For the rest of the troops, here's where I came out:
   <br />
   <br />
   JBJS-BR2: Phac
   <br />
   GSW Portal: Tien
   <br />
   eCarlyle: BH
   <br />
   Meeting abstract sites: BH
   <br />
   AACR VJs: Gregory
   <br />
   ACLS migration: Ellen, or catch as catch can.
   <br />
   AdV: (ASH Ed &amp; AAP Red &amp; ASH SAP) book
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
   PNAS redesign is not staffed, b/c it hasn't been quoted yet. I did tell
   <br />
   Jean to include PjM $$$ if she wanted one.
   <br />
   <br />
   I'm a little concerned b/c CHOICE is going to run long, and BMJ might
   <br />
   (looking at the requested release schedule), so I might be overextended
   <br />
   in Jan/Feb, but it's hard to call for sure.
   <br />
   <br />
   Anyway, would you have a look, and lemme know if you think this adds up,
   <br />
   or not?
   <br />
   <br />
   Thank you as always, I hugely appreciate your insights on this stuff.

         DS: Bloodjournal mobile website coming.
         <br />
         795 mobile web sites.&nbsp; OUP wants 270 more WiCKs.
         <br />
         Part of services used in mobile vouches and other services in H10 vs H20.
         <br />
         Mobile websites are dependent upon H20 only
         <br />
         Fulltext applicatoin is dependent upon RSS, which come from H10. Build TOC order H1O, ignores TOC manifest.&nbsp; RSS feeds for H2O, needs 2 weeks Mike Friedman. ALso not on roadmap.
         <br />
         <br />
         OPTIMIZED CONTENT shows up with poor styling&nbsp; on Mobile. . . . . . .&nbsp;&nbsp; So they're at the head of teh queue when we do the OM cleanup.

  TM: need mobile site that doesn't proxy from H1O, or we need an H2O shell site
  <br />
  A standalone mobile site is a roadmap for Q2
  <br />
  (article, FM pages, etc get proxied now)
  <br />
  <br />
  Q1, pull from a4d.
  <br />
  Q2 pilot (STKE not a good pilot)
  <br />
  <br />
  TC: Q1 delivery needed
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: ?? STKE isn't in H2O for Q1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Engineering didn't promise anything.
  <br />
  CC: Customer not driving?
  <br />
  BW: are.
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: You will not have an h2O site live in Q1.
  <br />
  Only thing that fits schedule is existing h2O site, that only uses their content. A private site to host content, and other required pages. Ron? Rachel?
  <br />
  RS: In theory that should work. But they do weird stuff.&nbsp; We could was a whooooole lot of time on a throwaway.
  <br />
  CJ: all the KE data ??? oh, not needed on Mobile.&nbsp;&nbsp; IF you leave the KE-extras out of it, and serve onlythe content, we can do that.
  <br />
  BW: John did not problem anything but the content.
  <br />
  <br />
  RS: Vanilla mobile, proxy H2O &quot;content&quot; site, cross fingers.
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: incorrect page number and dates, a flakey archive page - the things Matt/Dharm always sweat - will be an even bigger mess for STKE.
  <br />
  Once the content is loaded, we can just try this.
  <br />
  <br />
  TC to spec
  <br />
  <br />
  =======
  <br />
  <br />
  SMPTE SEARCH
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: nav can't be based on search. &quot;browse by&quot;. Spec exceeds what search can deliver.
  <br />
  Build a browse page purpose.
  <br />
  <br />
  Request was to use search to make a list of all articles of a particular type.
  <br />
  All standardas matching a particular criteria; then&nbsp; families; with individual standards; ....
  <br />
  <br />
  We could build a list for our list, like PAP page.
  <br />
  <br />
  TC: wanta to browse by 732.1 (if it's a family member) or 732. Wants to browse by the number range for that standard.&nbsp; Want to be able to browse &quot;0 to 50&quot;, etc.
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: So this result has two lists - the families, and the individual members.&nbsp; So we fire off multiple searches, and app's layer merges them.
  <br />
  <br />
  TC: Also, browse by topic, sent in metadata. Ex., &quot;camera&quot;.
  <br />
  <br />
  RS: or we cold build static pages
  <br />
  CJ: or we have a collection service, we coudl custom build particular indexes.
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ: I suggest we using existing collections (SMPTE standards are books;
  <br />
  top level collection f collections; atom store has top level collection of standards 9as book group). Needs blending.&nbsp; [explains combinatory logic]
  <br />
  Might want to create a service, which would be very cacheable, and never change until a new one was published
  <br />
  [families in one collection;&nbsp; standards in atom store] Algo based on standard name
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: sounds like you build a browsing app, based on existing collections
  <br />
  <br />
  RS/MK: That's a couple of weeks of work
  <br />
  ===================
  <br />
  <br />
  JBJSBR related article feature
  <br />
  <br />
  1 Specialty modeled as subject collection
  <br />
  2 search keywords
  <br />
  <br />
  No plan for anything on back issues
  <br />
  <br />
  PLT: How do we test this? we've asked for test content. 5 or 6 issues.
  <br />
  We don't have tool to make sure it's working well.
  <br />
  Resupply is only way to change anything.
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: They might want to add keywords to back content.
  <br />
  PLT: only two 2 will appear
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: for pub to permit edits to keywords in the atom store, and then kick off search reindexing
  <br />
  <br />
  PLT: and we'd have to avoid keywords getting overwritten by resupplies.
  <br />
  Until we have first results in hand, we don't know how much we need this or not. By early january, not much time left.
  <br />
  MK: This is a separate project, which they have decide they want, and will pay for.
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: Search engine provides its own heuristics for ordering results. Even if you had tool, it could take 15 minute after a change to see what the result is.
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: Interface, creates patch, which we post into the atom store. It then kicks off reindexing. And then it would have to clear one or more caches.
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: Estimate a week of work to get 80% there. THen Margo time. 6-8 days. off the cuff.

      <br />
      - need to do a lot of QA of their own. Things would be fixed, then busted again.
      <br />
      - didn't follow mockups to the letter
      <br />
      - cross browser testing missed

      &nbsp;&nbsp; 2a. Why we had one; what was discussed; whether it

        MB: ash ed book;&nbsp; Had to scramble to update file manager pages on another site; H1O JD was not up-to-date; Hemat Library.org.... graphical integration w/society site....
        <br />
        I interacted w/publisher, but she didn't include web developer on anything - until Right before migration.

        AdV: Polly was the original PbM, and we were told &quot;nothing special needed for the umbrella site&quot;.&nbsp; Add'l risk when a PbM staffing changes midway through.

        DS: There is a start difference between mobile...

        TC: Tien I put my foot down, re: elephant in room re: content provider 15-18 days.&nbsp; But we're 9 days from drop-dead deadline. Now suggesting that they go to early or mid January .
        <br />
        Also, conferences ends up in January, b/c&nbsp; standards goes first.
        <br />
        <br />
        STKE:TC: relationship manager done, needs teseting. Content loading coudl start quick. Spec completed by Polly. Need to have engineering review the Spec..
        <br />
        They want a date for full tech review of spec. They don't want to kill themselves and try to get it done now.

        PLT: ASHA - we loaded all samples, for 17sites. QA started last week. Rama... 3 sites reviewed, asked for more reviewed.&nbsp; Feedback encouraging.&nbsp; Meeting tomorrow re: buglist.. ASAH finally did their DNS changes
        <br />
        <br />
        AdV: Concerned that the limited # of bugs is an indication of how little QA Rama's been able to review the site.

         Clinchem: on schedule, 70+ bugs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Good shape.
         <br />
         BIR: content delayed a little. 25 bugs. contente load at end of weeks.
         <br />

         Angie:
         <br />

          3. TC on process mapping, Salesforce, Jira
          <br />
          <br />
          TC:&nbsp; pretty well done with mapping our existing workflows.
          <br />
          Did a flowchart, and RL and I took it to Tom. Incoming project process was most broken thing.&nbsp; Estimates come after we've committed to the project.
          <br />
          Meeting with RL and Viswa and Mark C to talk about alternate vision
          <br />
          <br />
          Today meeting, found workflow issues that precede any attempt to set up Jira.&nbsp; We'll start first w/Single developer tasks (75% of our tasks).&nbsp;&nbsp; Directors meet about this on Monday.&nbsp; They'll look at who should be driving this, now that the issue has been surfaced.
          <br />
          <br />
          1. need to find owner
          <br />
          2. prioritize business processes that need to be fixed
          <br />
          3. starting to fix things in an iterative fashion.
          <br />
          4. Focus on high value.
          <br />
          TC will continue to work for jira.
          <br />
          <br />
          RL: We'll work from 75% up to the RFP level...
          <br />
          RL: MK and XPS recommendation is to make the technical owner the person who has the most work. So if Rachel has 80% of the work, but needs 20% from CJ, she has to get the work out of JD.

  -BH:&nbsp; across whole group from staffing viewpoint
  <br />
  - TC: to help us with bleeding group
  <br />
  - AdV: managing sub part, plus some process
  <br />
  <br />
  + What does that look like going forward....
  <br />
  <br />
  = somehow looking to PgM andPjM in Engineering, too.
  <br />
  <br />
  - profitability
  <br />
  RL: Challenge of fixed price contracts. Maybe an agile (tme and materials)
  <br />
  <br />
  + Roadmap - AB can't do it all. She wants a cross-functional project manager. (not just technical, but marketing, rollout)
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  TC: wary of separate camps. Are they different processes, or incompatible processes
  <br />
  <br />
  TC: PMO has 3 or 4 functions. Run schedules/tactical; one to handle process;&nbsp; career management; facilitate process related documentation
  <br />
  <br />
  How do we split the functions....&nbsp; BH is great on defining schedules...
  <br />
  <br />
  [bh re: giveaways]
  <br />
  RL : we need to look at value of what we're giving away. TR wants us to customers value fo what we're giving them.

    RL/TC: Viswa is very technical, total focused in engineering
    <br />
    Help for AB. PbM gets prototypes out the door, as it gets productized, others will do it.&nbsp; PbMs are not PjMs.
    <br />
    RL: Many pilots and demos on the Roadmap get done in engineering
    <br />
    <br />
    TC: Would like to see a PjM map for the Roadmap.
    <br />
    For roadmap item &quot;foo&quot;, there might e a tech manager, but there's no overall PjM for &quot;foo&quot;, education marketing
    <br />
    RL: PdM does that. Definitively
    <br />
    <br />
    LA, LB are &quot;fully committed&quot;

    <br />
    RL: MK thinks Steve is clueless...
    <br />
    <br />
    RL: Peter L gave Customer Services a system that did not save them time. Allison had to get very specific to get it on track.&nbsp; We'll have to do the same - be very specific to get their needs met.&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to be process-conscious.
    <br />
    <br />
    TC: PL is a technical job doing the best he can, but we need an overall manager, just like Steve and Jira.
    <br />
    I can't do that with SMPTE and Science at the same time.
    <br />
    <br />
    TC: as soon as Science becomes non-dormant, I might not have time for Jira.

  Using Mahesh's recent experience as an example, it would be a good idea to make &quot;stakeholder identification&quot; a formal part of the PMO process, for every project, large or small.
  <br />
  <br />
  This would include internal and external stakeholders, and the template should definitely include webmasters.
  <br />
  <br />
  Note that this is one of the items in the Concept/Charter document.
  <br />
  <br />
  Please throw this one on the pile for items which we might formally adopt as part of our PMO processes.

  <br />
  In general, there are three categories of things: bug, change request, (everything else, = PRD)
  <br />
  <br />
  PRD is a business case/sort of functional spec. Not a tech spec.
  <br />
  <br />

  Functional spec might have things like use cases, screen shots, etc etc.

  NLM Medline Indexing Requirement for electronic journals (found by surfing)
  <br />
  http://www.pdfa.org/news/us-national-institutes-of-health-offers-pdfa-option-for-medline-indexing/
  <br />
  http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/ma11/ma11_ejournal.html
  <br />
  New policy:...
  <br />
  1. Provide NLM with XML-tagged data of its bibliographic citations.
  <br />
  2. Provide robust current access to all its content under a license allowing efficient support of NLM operations, onsite services, and interlibrary loan.
  <br />
  3. Have an acceptable arrangement for permanent preservation of, and access to, the published content.
  <br />
  2+3 can be met by membership in PMC, or in external archive plus deposit of PDF/A (for internal NLM operations) {David G authored}
  <br />
  <br />
  ======================================
  <br />
  <br />
  QUESTIONS
  <br />
  1. Are we going to be expected to keep these (larger) PDFs forever -- archiving them as we do the current ones?
  <br />
  (BW: guess is &quot;yes&quot;.)[PW: &quot;yes&quot;, ex for resupplies]
  <br />
  <br />
  2. Are we going to need to be able to make them available in any other way than the PubMed deposit? If yes, then what might you speculate?
  <br />
  (BW gut is &quot;yes&quot;. ) [PW: don't know of any others]
  <br />
  Big problem if we guess &quot;no&quot;, and it's wrong later on
  <br />
  <br />
  3. Will this be for content going forward only, or are we going to need to load back content with these additional PDFs?
  <br />
  (BW: guess &quot;yes&quot;.)[PW: make it separate project]
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Who:
  <br />
  0)&nbsp; typesetter should generate the pdfs.&nbsp; HW may not have the font library to embed, and there are other characteristics of archival pdf
  <br />
  <br />
  1) HWX team will need to develop a workflow to accept and process the second PDF variant.
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bw: we do need to change a workflow, we already have extra PDFs. Need to define naming convention, location in fiilesystem, that plus workflow,
  <br />
  <br />
  2) Deliveries to PubMed -- downstream deliveries to PubMed may also need to change
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bw: script that&nbsp; dominoes runs,&nbsp; makepubmedmatches.
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two places that we generate medlars format. Earlier, it was done in the parser (h1O still does this in places). 7 years ago, we said let's do this out of the db...&nbsp; The medlars generated by those two are slightly different. Script (evan?) needs to pick up the archival PDF, and then insert into the XML for this medlars the line that says &quot;and here's this PDF/A&quot;. So need a file configuration at the journal level, etc., that says if this is type A or B. Not sure if Paul S.
  <br />
  <br />
  3) Atom team for new variant
  <br />
  <br />
  4) JDs probably have to load new variant in h1o as well,�
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ? dominoes
  <br />
  <br />
  5) back data delivery would be separate
  <br />
  <br />
  6)&nbsp;&nbsp; We�ll need to price this service (including storage) as well.
  <br />
  <br />
  7) Access control as well if we ever want to serve it to users.
  <br />
  <br />
  Q4:
  <br />
  <br />
  Stakeholders:
  <br />
  Dom - PbM
  <br />
  <br />
  HWX: KH, NN, BW
  <br />
  PubMed team: Evan
  <br />
  Atom: Nick
  <br />
  JD:&nbsp; MK/PB/ =&gt; GS
  <br />
  cc:TM as option
  <br />
  <br />
  - How much work

  <br />
  &quot;Archival PDFs for online only journals to pubmed&quot;. We've been just sending abstracts, they want non-normal PDFs.

         &nbsp; beta, customer sign-off on beta, content complete,
         <br />
         &nbsp; cutting to prod, final customer approval, launch)

          <br />
          <br />
          TC: SMPTE-C will not launch on 15th. Need content from standards priroitized. . THey want standards done first.
          <br />
          Standards risk: Content, changes from reiviews, a/c,&nbsp; search [first H2O book search, and a/c]

                  GC: it will depend upon the individual project... some need internal sponsor signof, or customer sign off, etc.

  &gt;&gt; Hi, Ron.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; Had my meeting with Mahesh.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; Mahesh has some important personal business he needs to take care of.&nbsp; His father and mother live with him, and his father has dementia, which is worsening. His parents have asked him to take them back to India, so his father can settle retirement financial business.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; Mahesh has asked if it would be possible to take
  <b>
   <font>
    21 November though 2 December
   </font>
  </b>
  <font>
   off for the trip.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, as of 1 Nov,&nbsp; he has two migrations assigned. One migrates on 2 Nov (ASH Ed Book), and one on 15 November (AJS). We hope the latter will continue to be smoothly sailing.
   <br />
   &gt;&gt;
   <br />
   &gt;&gt; Given these facts alone, this looks fine to me.
   <b>
    <font>
     We can certainly get by
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    for those two weeks, handling whatever AJS cleanup there might be.
    <br />
    &gt;&gt;
    <br />
    &gt;&gt; The context confuses me.&nbsp; By 1 Nov, Mahesh is projected to be down to 30% FTE.&nbsp; I would normally be loading his plate back up now.
    <br />
    &gt;&gt; Report 55 https://www.quickbase.com/db/bgbjicgmb?a=q&amp;qid=19 &lt;https://www.quickbase.com/db/bgbjicgmb?a=q&amp;qid=19&gt;&nbsp; shows requests starting in November for
    <br />
    &gt;&gt; AORN PSRP ebook launch and Electrochemical Society launch (don't know if LOA is nailed quite yet or not).&nbsp; Also possibilities in the short term:&nbsp; CTSnet may come back to life;&nbsp; and JWatch looms (Any news there?)
    <br />
    &gt;&gt; Note that If he's out two weeks, that's two weeks we can spend on him later (i.e., after his return), fwiw.
    <br />
    &gt;&gt;
    <br />
    &gt;&gt; What do you think?
    <b>
     <font>
      Should I not try to load MB more at this point?&nbsp; Other thoughts?

    </b>
    <font>
     <br />
     &gt;&gt;
     <br />
     &gt;&gt; Re: other business at our meeting, Mahesh made a very decent representation of himself, and in particular showed that he was gaining familiarity with the journal system and its issues. Too bad.

       aptaguide, sepm and erm&nbsp; (and new AORN, new SEPM).
       <br />
       Wanted to focus on the platforms for existing publications. Big pushback from team on redbook.
       <br />
       <br />
       BW: OUPhandbooks in H10. We won't even put those on the schedule until we get most or all of the H1O dependencies onto H2O.&nbsp;&nbsp; So 2nd half of 2012.
       <br />
       BW: Redbook is different, b/c old versions are almost never used.
       <br />
       SEPM has over 150 books
       <br />
       ERM 40+
       <br />
       <br />
       PB: Books codebase will be a nightmare to sort.
       <br />
       MK: It may be cheaper to buy a new sofa than to reupholster the existing one.

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; new people doing launches, not a lot of visibility into them
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; launch process - especially the start - should be better defined

    =======================================
    <br />
    <br />
    RL: AdV came unglued while you were gone.
    <br />
    She missed first meeting, we did go-'round
    <br />
    Updates. Good meeting.
    <br />
    AdV should've let me know she was supposed to do that.
    <br />
    <br />
    I asked TC to do it, sent out agenda
    <br />
    &quot;Nobody thinks she's important.&quot;
    <br />
    Seems to have emerged less frequently since I've managed her.
    <br />
    Self-esteem issue.
    <br />
    The day I met her, she can to Palo Alto to resign. Spoke to her at lunch over Publisher Meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was my motivator to make community of practice. Give her a base.
    <br />
    <br />
    Making her migration maven was stroke of genius.
    <br />
    But where does she go from there. With end of journal migrations, what does that mean.
    <br />
    BH: Future in books? big enough?
    <br />
    RL: Is it big enough? Will it feed her self-esteem adequately?&nbsp;&nbsp; Books is a huge problem, can she help us with it?
    <br />
    BH: Books team? sense of place? process? etc.
    <br />
    RL: should book role extend into product management.
    <br />
    Traditional product management role is to do product vision and project management.

    Role relative to PMO is trickier. I had envisioned me running the&nbsp; PMO with TC as &quot;architect&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that doesn't have AdV in a role. She thought she had one.

         helpful to hear from PjMs on a weekly basis re: migrations:
         <br />
         - which projects they're on
         <br />
         - what milestones are upcoming (e.g. kickoff, alpha,
         <br />
         &nbsp; beta, customer sign-off on beta, content complete,
         <br />
         &nbsp; cutting to prod, final customer approval, launch)
         <br />
         - any problems they've encountered during the week
         <br />
         &nbsp; prior, and whether they have been resolved

               i've discussed this with a few other people, and the consensus is that
               <br />
               since we're 2+ weeks out [beyond] from the migration of jsedres/palaios, it falls to the pbm to track this to completion with site-support. however, whether that's the correct answer in general, whether that answer applies in this case, and how that answer should be communicated to lindat are questions that i would like bernard to comment on.
               <br />
               <br />
               bernard, perhaps we can discuss this question when the pmo meets this afternoon? the question is:
               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp; a bug (hw-wide or project-specfic) has not been resolved at
               <br />
               &nbsp; the 2-week mark that typically ends a pjm's involvement with
               <br />
               &nbsp; a migration. what is the pjm's responsibility as s/he leaves
               <br />
               &nbsp; the project?
               <br />
               <br />
               here are my thoughts:
               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp; - make sure the bug is present in quickbase (or jira, as we
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transition to the new tool)
               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp; - make sure the bug has been brought to the attention of the
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appropriate parties (xenia for content [at her request],
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; site-support for everything else [per paulb and xenia])
               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp; - meet with the pbm to review all outstanding bugs (they
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should all be in either quickbase or jira) and officially
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hand the project over
               <br />

                * What do I do with this all-HW bug?
                <br />
                Make sure bug is in QB; make sure assignment is clear;&nbsp; (straight to XPS if content);
                <br />
                - Be sure to have meeting with PbM to close the
                <br />
                - MB: I explain in an e-mail to the customer, cc: to the pbm, and tell them the QA sheet is open for 2 weeks, and then everything goes to the pbm.
                <br />
                - AdV: the platform-wide bugs might be stickier.

  * trouble getting engineering support. Matt asked Ron. Talk to Viswa.&nbsp; Almost have no support for last 3 or 4 weeks. 20% of what we had.&nbsp; We need a dedicated person.

  * India team is not getting through. Not knowing our systems. Has been no formal handoff or training. THey can push code to github, but then no one pulls it down.&nbsp;&nbsp; India person is not a Sr Architect level.

  Anupam's&nbsp; suggestions, his work was &quot;shabby&quot;.
  <br />
  <br />
  Lack of training, transition. prioritize.
  <br />
  TM not pushing. Mobile competes with everything else. And Mobile 1.2 will be surpassed by Mobile 2.0, but that's a year away. We can't sign up new publishers and expect to support this.

  Matt went to Ron, and Ron went to Viswa.

  LT doesn't think we need to fix SSABULL's punctuation in the appendix.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  BIR: Rama 11/23 (day before thanksgiving for point to prod); thanksgiving week is slow, qa will need 3 extra days. Can we launch 12/12.
  <br />
  Prelaunch will be primarily morgan (m/w/f) 12/5-12/9 for fixes and cushion).
  <br />
  Can we launch week of 12/12
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Phac: When we launch a journal w/o content,
  <br />
  <br />
  Recommend: Tell Sharon we think there should be an LOA item that says, &quot;You ask us to launch w/o content, you should be recover some costs.

    <br />
    <br />
    BIR: 1swt project team meeting tomorrow morn. still on for 12/7 launch
    <br />
    <br />
    SMPTE: discovered search team bit got lost. CJ didn't represent it.� Message not delivered.� Fight with Choice.
    <br />
    <br />
    STKE: content migraition - Start loading soon. Starting out plan for site build and feature work.
    <br />
    <br />
    JBJSBR: ... no content yet.� NLM tagging not really good. Some content problems.� Concerned re: JD resource.�� Xia has development of new features to do, she's too busy w/data supplement migration. Don't think I have enough resources. Yellow alert.
    <br />
    <br />
    AJNR: migrating tomorrow. {fingers crossed}
    <br />
    <br />
    4 geosites: prelaunch QA this week. ssabull, econgeo, jsedres, palios
    <br />
    <br />
    ASH ed book: beta - completed feedback period
    <br />
    <br />
    AJS: beta starts on Monday.
    <br />
    <br />
    JAHAA: migrating wednesday
    <br />
    <br />
    Ortho: Oct 25. Up against content loading deadline. for signoff on 30th.
    <br />
    <br />
    ===================================================
    <br />
    Next segment involved Phac's long-standing item re: &quot;inter-departmental project structure&quot;, i.e., how does he get what he needs from Engineering. We heard Mark C has hired a &quot;technical program manager&quot;, (&quot;Vishwa&quot;?)� who will help him project-manage his department. How, and what the implications are for the PjMs, has yet to unfold. But it's gotta help!�
    <br />
    <br />
    Ron said &quot;Going forward, ideally we're doing LESS ONE-OFF WORK.&quot;� Which I liked.
    <br />
    ======
    <br />
    Finally, we had a guest star: Rama. He spoke about QA and migrations, which we seem to get wrong regularly.�
    <br />
    <br />
    * Need QA in 6 places
    <br />
    Alpha - [JD or PjM sends mail to QA &quot;Hey, site is ready, sample content there]. WE NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU.. QA then confirms. 2 days-1 wk elapsed FOR ONE JOURNAL
    <br />
    <br />
    Beta - publihser does this testing
    <br />
    <br />
    Content -� Pan era/ previous era. 99% of musikaar + automated. 1 week of elapse for 1 or 2 days of testing.
    <br />
    <br />
    Pre-launch -� 2 week prelaunch for Multijournal migrations.� Has to happen after cut to prod. Site typically has had changes. Also fixed items..� Local team.
    <br />
    <br />
    Launch day - short 1 hr local team. (Jeff or Rama). Acceptance / Sanity test level.
    <br />
    <br />
    post-launch -� Good idea, but we don't have resources to do it.
    <br />
    <br />
    Other comments
    <br />
    + Multijournal migration planning - needs more padding, even when sites are identical, content problems arise.
    <br />
    + leave a cushion!: QA gets &quot;squished&quot;.
    <br />
    + &quot;content load prerequisite&quot; - new column in QA spreadsheet.

  RL: Be SURE to let RL&nbsp; know BEFORE Ian runs out of money. Projection.&nbsp; DON'T LET HIM SLOW DOWN when he gets near.
  <br />
  <br />
  RL: ACTION: reply to your own e-mail ....&nbsp; not all
  <br />
  &nbsp; I can try to open the wider issue of Drupal is not for everything.
  <br />
  Ron won't even let me make my point about Drupal not being supported.
  <br />
  <br />
  ======
  <br />
  <br />
  2 or 3 contractors into March / APril timeframe.
  <br />
  <br />
  Roadmap + professional service paradigm.&nbsp; We've got to nail a whole bunch of revenue, to keep them beyond March/April.
  <br />
  <br />
  We have to be generating revenues before that to provde we cann continue them.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  ===========================
  <br />
  <br />
  OUP LP/AB dump on Angie
  <br />
  <br />
  * reassign to LP? or DM?&nbsp; or MJ?
  <br />
  <br />
  Calling angie:
  <br />
  1) RL: please reassign those OUP tasks to Louise.&nbsp; PbM needs to own these maybe take them to Warp.
  <br />
  <br />
  AdV: 2 of these tasks have been around for *years*.&nbsp;&nbsp; LP assigned them to Bill...&nbsp; And AdV is on phone with OUP every week, and they ask her about them.
  <br />
  <br />
  RL: Louise doens't get to do this. &quot;I'm horrified.&quot; Draft your role PjM wise for OUP.
  <br />
  <br />
  2) for AB, request to help move books machinery into h20.
  <br />
  AB sent reuqest for status. I responded &quot;nothing&quot;, no one is updating me.
  <br />
  Todd and CJ downgraded red alert status, AdV not concerned.
  <br />
  <br />
  If I send a QB/Jira update, how long before I escalate.

   In H2O we don't put the period if it's not there.
   <br />
   Mike, Xenia, Bill: we don't do this.
   <br />
   Why did you do it in h1O, and not H2o, you're maknig us look bad.

   <br />
   AdV: Adding the punctuation might be easy.&nbsp; Difficult customer. Ask BW and XPS.

  Drupal site developers will move into ROn's organization, once the migrations are done.
  <br />
  <br />
  The team in India will do the build
  <br />
  Mark C will get a Technical Project Manager&nbsp; to ride herd on TM, CJ, India
  <br />
  <br />
  The TC will ride herd on JD, Content, a/c, etc will be pjm for the rest
  <br />
  <br />
  * How would TC work with PjM in Engineering
  <br />
  <br />
  TC: I'd like to get a process in place. A one pager for each feature. Time box it. Ex., we'll put 6 weeks in on each feature.
  <br />
  Nancy like structure. Within those 6 weeks, they can change whatever they want, and then if they go over...
  <br />
  TImebox reviews.
  <br />
  Develop, demo, then get feedback.
  <br />
  Generally an agile-ish framework. I.e., useable
  <br />
  <br />
  BH: you'll have to work parallel on UI. Remember, Drupal is all new UI platform.
  <br />
  <br />
  Engineering deliverable date on a per-feature basis.
  <br />
  <br />
  Asked Polly to write the one pagers for the features.
  <br />
  <br />
  Drupal developers are in Indian company &quot;Faichee&quot;, (???)

  Hi Ron.
  <br />
  <br />
  I have some projections for next year, per your request @ our 11am meeting.&nbsp; There's a lot of creative interpolation in the numbers, as you might imagine.
  <br />
  <br />
  Migrations: 4 FTEs
  <br />
  Between January and end of June, I project 4 FTEs are required.&nbsp; If things go well in Q1 and Q2, this will tail off to about 1 FTE in June (but a lot depends upon when projects actually start)
  <br />
  <br />
  Launches: 20% FTE
  <br />
  If we are&nbsp; carrying the AORN launch,&nbsp;&nbsp; it'll be about 20% for the first two months in 2012
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Special Projects: 3.5 FTE
  <br />
  In this period, we need approximately 3 FTEs to handle the large special projects we know about. This includes
  <br />
  85% mobile etc. product rollouts
  <br />
  60% general books items
  <br />
  <font>
   <br />
   35% JBJS-BR Phase 2
   <font>
    <br />
    <font>
     60% AAP Portal 2015
     <br />
     65% Science mag Drupal reimplementation
     <br />
     50% Paleosource,
     <br />
     [included, not yet funded]
     <font>
      <br />
      <br />
      * This does NOT include miscellaneous smaller projects, which we may expect to receive from the PbMs (like AACR taxonomy, or PNAS/ACS linking).
      <br />
      <br />
      Administrative:&nbsp; .75% FTE
      <br />
      Migration coordination (15%, AdV) and PMO management (60%, BH) are projected to continue at approximately current levels.
      <br />
      <br />
      ====================
      <br />
      <br />
      Notes:
      <br />
      * The OUP books migration to H2O is going to be big and complex.&nbsp; I've currently pegged it at 65%. It may need to be split between an subject matter expert PjM, and another helpful unit
      <br />
      <br />
      * I included AORN largely to call out launches, which are one of the more common emergent projects.
      <br />
      <br />
      * Lydia B, and Linda A, seem to be fully tasked with &quot;permanent projects&quot; concerning&nbsp; Sage, BMJ, and OUP.&nbsp; So while our office permanent FTE count is 5 (BH, AdV, TC, LB, LA) on paper, only three of those FTEs, to my knowledge, are available to address the needs indicated above.
      <br />
      <br />
      * The total FTE request is about 8.5 FTE.&nbsp; We currently have 3 permanent FTE available to apply against this.
      <br />
      * If the contracts are still to be drawn for Portal 2015, Science reimplementation, and Paleosource, you of course could reduce the FTE ask by&nbsp; 1.75 FTE, provided those contracts explicitly included the FTEs here estimated.

          11:46 &lt;bing13&gt; But given what we know, do you think that its something like a 50% FTE effort, for the migration, say Jan-jun 2012?
          <br />
          11:47 &lt;angie&gt; At least.
          <br />
          11:47 &lt;angie&gt; The prospect of actually being done with the books migrations by the middle of next year makes me kind of chuckle.
          <br />
          11:48 &lt;angie&gt; I'm expecting it to take longer than that, and to involve more time than 4 hours per day.
          <br />
          11:48 &lt;angie&gt; The books project by itself is currently at 60% FTE.
          <br />
          11:48 &lt;angie&gt; And I think that the H2O migration is going to be worse.
          <br />
          11:48 &lt;bing13&gt; Right. I stopped at June b/c that was the end of the horizon ron asked for, I didn't meant o imply it would be *done* at that point
          <br />
          11:48 &lt;angie&gt; Ah. Got it.

           12:42 &lt;angie&gt; Also, we will need some of Anh's time to plan our attack on all book sites.

    1a) AdV: I don't feel overburndened. My role at hw is unclear.
    <br />
    People say to me you're critical to XYZ, etc.
    <br />
    I don't know what to do w/migration management. I don't have astaff, I don't have time to build the PMO
    <br />
    I don't understand the &quot;Migration maven&quot; role.&nbsp; &quot;Go to resource&quot; that no body asks me.
    <br />
    Or bill/john/tom go to other people with their questions about migrations.&nbsp; I feel it's a misnomer.
    <br />
    I sit in these meetings, and I take notes, and circulate.&nbsp; I don't want to be a secretary.
    <br />
    <br />
    M/A/X - margo and Xenia have info on migrations, and meet with staff, and do the updates.&nbsp; AdV doesn't know - vacations, updates, anything.&nbsp;&nbsp; I get asked questions, and then I do reserach.
    <br />
    <br />
    <font>
     THIS IS PART OF&nbsp; A BIGGER PROBLEM, AT HW DO i HAVE A CAREER? DO I HAVE A SKILL SET?&nbsp; It's hampered b/c I'm a remote employee. IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT B/C I'M NOT THERE...&nbsp; i don't know if there is an answer.

    Here's a summary of my observations; a more verbose version of this info,
    <br />
    organized by PjM, can be found following my signature.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    1.&nbsp; PMO Problems
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    1a. Target date slippages
    <br />
    1b. Lack of training/oversight
    <br />
    1c. Lack of project ownership?
    <br />
    1d. Insufficient resources to meet demand
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    2.&nbsp; PMO Projects Without Resources
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    2a. CTSNet (4 sites + CME + custom XSLT)
    <br />
    2b. AACC (1 site)
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    3.&nbsp; PMO Projects With Staffing Concerns
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    3a. Ellen:&nbsp; ASHS (3 sites + umbrella)
    <br />
    3b. Mahesh: GSW &quot;mirrors&quot; (4 sites)
    <br />
    3c. Mahesh: ASH bloodbook + umbrella
    <br />
    3d. Ellen:&nbsp; GSW (40 sites)
    <br />
    3e. Mahesh: ATS (3 sites + cme + umbrella)
    <br />
    3f. Mahesh: BIR (3 sites + umbrella)
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    4.&nbsp; PMO Projects Without Schedules
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    4a. Phac: ASHA Newsletters (16 sites + umbrella)
    <br />
    4b. Tien: AAAS (stke/sigtrans)

    <br />
    1. Ellen:
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; ASHS is at 20%, and appears to be off-schedule in her
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; absence. Is anybody covering her on either the PbM or
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the PjM side?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; GSW is at 50%, and Margo has concerns about whether
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ellen is the right person for the job. Perhaps we
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should meet up with her to discuss when she's back at
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work next week?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; Can take on one more, perhaps she can pick up ASH
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from Mahesh?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; If GSW goes elsewhere, I see her as handling ATS and
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perhaps AACC (clinchem).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    2. Gregory:
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; Looks like you've got him on the AAP Portal (what is
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that?) with time available; perhaps we can have him
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help us with training, or documentation, in addition
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to putting him on a migration (perhaps BIR)?
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    3. LindaA will be unavailable after ORTHO is done.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    4. Mahesh is overbooked:
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; -- Is INFORMS actually done?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; -- What is the status of AJNR -- substantially complete?
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much time is he spending on that one these days?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; -- The 3 LindaT projects feel like a mess, but I'm not
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sure if that's an argument for keeping him on them or
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; putting someone new into the mix. Thoughts?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; -- ASH (bloodbook) is a mess; I would argue for taking
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him off that one (see above).
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; -- AJS feels like an easy one, but I'm not involved -- do
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you know anything more about it?
    <br />
    <br />
    <font>
     &nbsp;&nbsp; -- ATS is complicated and off to a bad start; I've done
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more to move it forward in the last 24 hours than has
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; either the PbM or the PjM; we need a HWP-experienced
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PjM on this one:
     <font>
      <b>
       <font>

        <font>

      </b>
      <font>
       Part of the
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problem is that it's a Greg customer, and he is a real
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; challenge to manage all by himself.
       <font>
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; -- BIR needs to start up very soon; perhaps Gregory can
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work on this one with someone like Lydia or you or me
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shadowing?
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        5. Phac:
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; -- JBJS-BR is at 65%: huge and complicated.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; -- biolbull should complete today; is there a debrief
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scheduled for this one?
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; -- ASHA Newsletters have restarted at 20%.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; -- Is Phac better suited for an &quot;easier&quot; project (a la
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AACC (clinchem) or a &quot;harder&quot; one (a la CTSNet)?
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        6. Tien appears to be full up -- she's got STKE, now?

    I'm glad you think it looks fine!
    <br />
    <br />
    I'm sure the reasons for not doing all the projects this way were laid out
    <br />
    for you before; there are, unfortunately, many. Here are a few:
    <br />
    <br />
    1. sites were built differently from one another on H1O, and in most cases
    <br />
    their peculiarities are not documented anywhere
    <br />
    <br />
    2. in most cases, the original builders have long since left HighWire
    <br />
    <br />
    3. each site's set of standard features is not reliably documented; we try
    <br />
    to make up for that by having PbMs fill out the Installables, but in most
    <br />
    cases PbMs have inherited their site from somebody who has long since left
    <br />
    HighWire, so they are often just poking around themselves
    <br />
    <br />
    4. custom site features are not reliably documented; see above
    <br />
    <br />
    5. content workflows vary from site to site, and from era to era within a
    <br />
    site; folks who did crazy crap with the content some time ago have long
    <br />
    since left HighWire
    <br />
    <br />
    6. content quality REALLY varies, sometimes from article to article within
    <br />
    a given issue; see above
    <br />
    <br />
    7. our customers have very different approaches to working with HighWire,
    <br />
    and I will refrain from expressing my opinion about why that is or how we
    <br />
    ended up here; some are easy going, take our advice, and trust us; some
    <br />
    are difficult, critical, adversarial, etc., and it is not possible to take
    <br />
    the &quot;bundled&quot; approach with the latter type of customer
    <br />
    <br />
    It's important to keep in mind that HighWire has been operating since
    <br />
    1995, when the internet was still new, and long before there were more or
    <br />
    less &quot;universal&quot; standards about how to use it. There is a lot of history
    <br />
    (much of it very ugly) built into the sites, as well as into our
    <br />
    relationships with our customers.
    <br />
    <br />
    Taking a more directive approach to these migrations would have been super
    <br />
    awesome, and I'm sure we could have done better than we did, but we didn't
    <br />
    go that route for the reasons listed above, and probably others of which
    <br />
    I'm unaware.
    <br />
    <br />
    Anyway.
    <br />
    <br />
    Yes, the same QA teams (internal and Musikaar) are used for bundled
    <br />
    projects.
    <br />
    <br />
    I agree that it would be helpful to get the QA test suites squared away;
    <br />
    that's Rama's job, but I believe he has been tasked with higher priority
    <br />
    projects during the last six months. For better or worse. FWIW, we had no
    <br />
    QA teams at all until late last year, so even though it still kinda sucks,
    <br />
    it's so much better than it was it's not even funny. If you have specific
    <br />
    concerns, perhaps we can set up a meeting with Rama when he gets back from
    <br />
    India to discuss them.
    <br />
    <br />
    One person
    <b>
     <font>
      *is*
     </font>
    </b>
    <font>
     managing all the bundles. His name is Paul Beetlestone,
     <br />
     and he reports to Margo. The reason we're not taking this on within the
     <br />
     PMO is that PjMs are needed for the more complicated projects. Bundles are
     <br />
     assumed to be (A) easy sites for (B) easy customers.

     Hi Angie,
     <br />
     <br />
     This looks fine, and in the direction of what I was advocating when I
     <br />
     first started: one small dedicated team in charge of the whole process
     <br />
     from A-Z. I assume it also includes the same QA team to make sure the
     <br />
     knowledge is leveraged. The simplification of the back and forth with the
     <br />
     customer is a great idea. It would help to have a full assessment of the
     <br />
     QA test suites to make sure we check at least the known bugs that have
     <br />
     been found recently by publishers in other migrations.
     <br />
     <br />
     In addition, I have a question: Why not have one PjM manage all the bundle
     <br />
     migrations at the same time? There needs to be one person to oversee the
     <br />
     whole process. Would that be Margo?

        Hi Phac,
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm sure you're not the only one who is new to this concept; I'm not 100%
        <br />
        on it myself.
        <br />
        <br />
        In a nutshell, the primary goal of a bundled migration is to reduce the
        <br />
        amount of back and forth we have with the customer. A secondary goal (and
        <br />
        frankly, the one I'm most interested in here) is to remove the PMO from
        <br />
        the project entirely. Bundled migrations are managed by Margo's &quot;migration
        <br />
        team&quot; of developers, along with the PbMs. PjMs are not involved. This
        <br />
        would free you up for a project that cannot be bundled.
        <br />
        <br />
        The major differences between a bundled migration and a standard migration
        <br />
        can be seen when you compare the milestone targets of the two types:

                 The biggest differences are that we (A) don't ask the customer for design
                 <br />
                 input, and (B) don't ask the customer to review sample content. There are
                 <br />
                 also differences in timing of all the moving parts.
                 <br />
                 <br />
                 Let me know if that makes sense and/or if you'd like to discuss further.

                 Hi Angie,
                 <br />
                 <br />
                 This is probably obvious to everyone but me, but could you please explain
                 <br />
                 in a few words what is behind the concept of bundled migration? i assume
                 <br />
                 this is to shorten the schedule or reduce the amount of resources
                 <br />
                 required, but does this also mean we limit the amount of QA overall?
                 <br />
                 Thanks for your help.

      1.&nbsp; include any milestones that have been missed

  I'm frankly concerned that we keep adding new PjMs to the mix without
  <br />
  <font>
   proper oversight;
   <font>
    hearing from LindaT yesterday that it was Rich's fault
    <br />
    that three of her projects are now behind schedule -- especially since I
    <br />
    asked Mahesh for status two weeks ago and he said they were all on
    <br />
    schedule -- makes me think we need to do something differently.
    <br />
    <br />
    Do you have one-on-one meetings with new PjMs to do status updates on a
    <br />
    weekly basis? If not, should we implement something like that? I know I'm
    <br />
    supposedly the migration 'maven,' but I'm not a people manager so I've
    <br />
    hesitated to insert myself into anybody's schedule like that. However, it
    <br />
    seems like somebody's gotta do it. Let me know if that somebody should be
    <br />
    me.
    <br />
    <br />
    Do we need to formally assign experienced PjMs to shadow new ones? I think
    <br />
    that LydiaB has been working with Mahesh on the three GSW mirror sites I
    <br />
    referenced above, but even she was unable to prevent this date change, it
    <br />
    would seem.
    <br />
    <br />
    Anyway, I think my preference would be to talk with you about how to stop
    <br />
    up whatever gaps are currently causing problems and then move on from
    <br />
    there to where we're going to add Gregory to the mix, and whether Tien
    <br />
    should take on STKE. (That's another one that I'm concerned about: Margo
    <br />
    told me last week that there were problems with RSMP that Tien should have
    <br />
    done something about, but that because she's new she let them slide. I
    <br />
    should have rejoined the RSMP project after returning from vacation, I
    <br />
    think; when I asked Tien for an update, she said it was going fine apart
    <br />
    from slow content loading. Apparently it was not.)

  Rama,

  Most of these punchlist items were initially reported by the customer. So I do think that in most cases, they will need
  <br />
  to live in SalesForce. And then be generated in JIRA as well (for internal prioritization and action). We can certainly do
  <br />
  that, once those 2 tools are ready for prime time.

 Even though we have not fully migrated to Jira, I suggest for these pending punch list tasks, entering them directly in Jira may be beneficial. Quickbase to Salesforce and thence to Jira can be avoided for these recent (less than 1 year) punch list tasks.
  <br />
  <br />
  Sara's experience with Jira is quite positive.

  Hello all,
  <br />
  <br />
  Here are my notes from today's call. ACTION items are included inline.
  <br />
  Additions and corrections are welcome.

  Thanks,

  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 0a. Punchlists. Existing process: GoogleDoc spreadsheet would
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remain active for a few weeks following migration, but
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would then be retired with all open tasks transferred to
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QuickBase for assessment, assignment, and pick-up by the
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PbM.
  <br />
  <br />
  **ACTION: Angie will track down spreadsheets for migrations
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; managed by PjMs and will work with PjMs to close
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out and move open items into QuickBase. If that
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; effort is not too onerous, she may be willing to
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help PbMs with this, as well, but as a first step
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thinks we should focus on having the PbSs lend a
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hand, if possible.

  Angie, all,
  <br />
  <br />
  Update on ASHASIG content loading (item #4g). The content massage was completed earlier this week, and
  <br />
  content loading is in progress. It is slated to complete tomorrow, or by Monday -- if we keep that on track, we'll
  <br />
  end up ahead of schedule.

  Hello all,
  <br />
  <br />
  Here are my notes from today's call. ACTION items are called out inline.
  <br />
  Additions and corrections are welcome.
  <br />
  <br />
  Thanks,
  <br />
  Angie

  1. OUP Journals Umbrella migration
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - significant time requirement from LisaW?
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - in progress, or not yet?
  <br />
  <br />
  Xenia: E-mail from Dharm re
  <b>
   <font>
    : voucher problem(s
   </font>
  </b>
  <font>
   ).
   <br />
   <br />
   Margo: Greg is looking into it now. If it can be
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resolved on H1O site, migration becomes
   <b>
    <font>
     less
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; critical
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    . If it can't, migration becomes more
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urgent.
    <br />
    <br />
    Margo: Either Karen or LisaW would do migration if
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; migration is needed. Can probably take what
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we did for the GSW Portal (the way it's been
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; broken down) and apply to OUP. Doesn't think
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it will be a terribly big project.
    <br />
    <br />
    ** ACTION: Margo to clarify next steps with Greg and
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the OUP team.
    <br />

    2. ACLS migration

    <b>
     <font>
      ~14 Dec
     </font>
    </b>
    <font>
     (within the next month?)
     <br />
     <br />
     All: We'll talk to Ellen about this after GSW, and it
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should be safe to kickoff in early Jan.
     <br />
     <br />
     ** ACTION: AdeV to work with PbM to get customer
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; buy-in on tentative schedule.

     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - should kickoff ~28 Dec (early next year?)
     <br />
     <br />
     Margo: There is a custom design in play. Do they want
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to keep or go standard?
     <br />
     <br />
     ** ACTION: AdeV to work with PbM to get customer
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; buy-in on tentative schedule, as well as
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to
     <b>

      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; UNLESS SOMEBODY WAVES ME OFF IN THE MEANTIME. **
      <br />
      <br />
      MK/XS: This one *is* migrating today; showstoppers
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have been addressed.
      <br />

      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the 30th if we don't have content loaded.
      <br />
      <br />
      Xenia: This one doesn't have red flags on content
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; side.

      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not installed; PjM asks whether there is a

         .
         <br />
         <br />
         Margo: As far as RelMgr is concerned, Road Map may
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obviate need for it altogether. We'll need to
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wait and see.
         <br />
         <br />
         Xenia: Sigtrans -- we're getting ready to start
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loading the full content, but we're waiting on
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the RelMgr. Should we continue to wait?
         <br />
         <br />
         Margo: JeffP estimates he will have it installed in
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prod by the end of November. Note from Nancy
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gough which seemed to indicate RelMgr would
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be done yesterday.
         <br />
         <br />
         Angie: Should STKE be discussed during weekly MPAX
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meetings?
         <br />
         <br />
         MK/XS: Probably not necessary; this one is a custom
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drupal project, not really a migration, and is
         <br />

         Xenia: This one has a tight schedule and it has been

     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margo: Did have a kickoff. LydiaB is managing,
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; separate from normal process. Should we
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fold her launches in here?
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xenia: Tien, Tom, and other directors are now
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; talking about processes, including
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; launch.
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margo: Although resource pool for BMJ is
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; different, it might be good to have all
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; projects in one place. However, for
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certain processes (e.g. OUP launches,
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SAGE launches) a Next_100 component
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; might be seen as new overhead.
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angie: Has experienced resource contention on
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the JD and systems side for OUP-Books,
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which are not tracked in Next_100; that
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; launch process probably impacts others,
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in turn.
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All: Let's revisit once we have moved from
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QuickBase to Salesforce and JIRA to see
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how we might use one or the other new tool
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to better manage resources, including for
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; large publishers that have dedicated teams.

      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; All: Let's discuss these two next week when Paul is back in
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; action. Kickoffs are 6+ weeks away.
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Margo: Would be good to
      <font>
       validate that the VJ work we've done
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for AAP will work for AACR.
       <font>
        That's a question for
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig and Sudhanshu. Let's talk to Paul on the best
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; way to get that information.
        <br />
        <br />
        ACTION: Margo will talk to Karen about doing an H1O analysis, to
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; start.
        <br />
        <br />
        ACTION: Angie will add this to next week's M-PAX agenda.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Angie: ETB confirmed that the VJ work does NOT need to begin
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in 2011, but advised that

         </font>

         . Still waiting to hear back as to whether
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it will be migrated as a journal or a book.
         <br />
         <br />
         ACTION: Angie will continue to seek info from ETB on Ed Book.
         <br />
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp; Xenia: How about AAP Red Book; meeting at noon today. Will
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that be migrated as book?
         <br />
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp; All: Seems still TBD; maybe we'll find out today.

  Hello all,
  <br />
  <br />
  Here are my notes from our morning session; ACTION items have been
  <br />
  included inline. Additions and corrections are welcome.
  <br />
  <br />
  Angie
  <br />
  <br />
  --------------------
  <br />
  <br />
  1. Debriefing re: bundled QA process, findings?
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Walked thru process with Rama, identified
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; things that were missed, many had to do with
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relative timing of migration work vs when
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; things are QAd. Rama will be writing up a
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; summary.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Seems like we didn't anticipate the level of
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feedback.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Yes, end of the process was chaotic. Also,
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; something reported broken for Duke is still
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; broken, and was reported as part of the
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bundle.
  <br />
  <br />
  **ACTION: Rama or Paul to circulate list of findings
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to team.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  ---------------
  <br />
  2. ACLS migration
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - kickoff ~14 Dec
  <br />
  3. AACR Virtual Journals migration
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - kickoff ~28 Dec
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Should we kick these off in Jan 2012, so that
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we don't schedule work during the end-of-year
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blackout?
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Did we commit to starting work on either in
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2011? Perhaps we should discuss with Bill.
  <br />
  <br />
  **ACTION: Angie to add to 2pm agenda.

  <br />
  4. Update on umbrella migrations?
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - Simpler:
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- aacrjnls (#293)
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- cshljnls (#303
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - Harder:
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- dupjnls (#304)
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- oupjournals (#135)
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Still need to staff these. FYI, GSW is
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pretty much staffed.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; XS: FAQ for migration prepared by LindaT,
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; April 2012 is the date she is planning to
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tell the customer.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Will circulate GSW Portal plan to the
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; group; very technical project, need to
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identify PjM.
  <br />
  <br />
  **ACTION: Paul will staff umbrella migrations.
  <br />
  <br />
  **ACTION: Margo will circulate GSW Portal plan to
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the group.

  <br />

  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * ORANGE FLAG: coverlines development with
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick; he hopes to have his part in place
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weds; A. will check in with him Weds; ASM
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expects this to be ready prior to go-live
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Concerns about ASM asking for custom
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work, changing their mind, expecting
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes to be implemented free of charge.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: Doesn't sense that this will be a
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problem.

  ----------
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 5c. ajs on track for 15 Nov
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Didn't other GSW sites drop this view?
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Bigger issue for this customer to drop
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the GeoRef &quot;abstract&quot; than for others;
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may be able to deal with it on the UI
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; side.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Content is fully loaded; hopefully no
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reloading will be necessary.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ellen manage the project
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Working with Linda and Ellen; a bit
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; worrying, things have been missed, will
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be meeting with PbM, PjM, JDs to plan out
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; next steps.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Anything content related?
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Not so much. Links missing, logos not in
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place, more site and UI stuff is pending.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Meeting with Sara this morning to check
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on H1O GSW facelift.

   <br />

    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drive the feedback process.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Alan can push back, but sometimes jumps
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in and fixes things.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Same with Xia; she may just fix things in
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; order to move on.

    &nbsp;&nbsp; 5g. ashasig status requested from Phac
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Feels like Phac is not really focused on
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this one; Xia is driving the technical
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work and development concerns.

     : Kathryn volunteered to take the lead to put
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; together a strategy document
     <font>
      ; once that's
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drafted and discussed, we can put together a
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; schedule.
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Perhaps a single PjM can handle all of these
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if we have an actual strategy document.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; development?
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; MK: During roadmap meeting, Kathryn and Craig
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were clear that the H2O books platform
      <font>
       needs
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be &quot;fixed&quot; for the existing books before
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we migrate the rest of them.
       <font>
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Is the plan not to migrate the books until we
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have the platform sorted out?
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Todd suggested leaving Red Book where it is
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until we sort out the platform.

    1. QA
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - Further thoughts on how guidelines might be
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; improved in light of publisher feedback on
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bundled sites?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: How are we closing feedback loop with
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rama's team?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All: We're not.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Xenia, Margo, and Paul are all meeting

    <br />
    <br />

    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mycologia
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Is following up with PbMs for status.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: When are our next milestones?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Feedback due by tomorrow (in most cases)
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and by Friday (for Dom's/haematol).
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Are we going to go live with sites for
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; publishers that don't provide feedback,
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without explicit written approval?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: For one site - Ellen's - we don't expect
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any feedback, so we might go ahead.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Perhaps discuss in today's 2pm?
    <br />
    <br />
    **ACTION: ANGIE WILL ADD TO 2PM AGENDA.

    3. Other migrations
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - ssabull
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: CSS bug is preventing author names from
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; displaying on TOC for certain types of
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content encoding.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Suspects that we're still on for tomorrow.
    <br />
    <br />
    **ACTION: ANGIE WILL DOUBLE-CHECK WITH MAHESH.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - ortho+umbrella
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Cut to prod, on track.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - bloodbook+umbrella
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Believes we're on track.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Certain links to PubMed won't work on H2O.
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will be fixed just after migration so that
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H1O links continue to work in the meantime.
    <br />
    <br />
    **ACTION: ANGIE WILL DOUBLE-CHECK WITH MAHESH.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - ASM+umbrella
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: One bit of development with JimR.
    <br />
    <br />
    **ACTION: ANGIE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH CRAIG/JIM.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - ajs
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: No known problems.
    <br />
    <br />
    **ACTION: ANGIE WILL DOUBLE-CHECK WITH MAHESH.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - GSW (w/o portal umbrella)
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Still moving along, what's the status of
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content loading / threads?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Limiting factor won't be thread count, but
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bandwidth of the CA to fix any problems
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that emerge during loading (via HWX). Put
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another resource on this. There might be
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another bottleneck with H2O / HWX Triage
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people.
    <br />
    <br />
    **ACTION: XENIA WILL DISCUSS WITH BILL/KATHRYN.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: What are we doing in terms of QA on these
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sites?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Decided to do limited QA on GeoRef era.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Site stuff in-hand?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Yes, we're in good shape. Very little left
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to do.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Doing staging site approach?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Yes.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Since we can't create the staging sites
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until content complete, are we going to
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have enough time?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Getting the staging sites up won't take
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Should discuss offline whether there are
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; restrictions on development of staging
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sites prior to content complete.
    <br />
    <br />
    **ACTION: MARGO AND PAUL WILL DISCUSS OFFLINE.
    <br />

    <br />
    <br />
    **ACTION: ANGIE WILL DOUBLE-CHECK WITH GREGORY.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - BIR+umbrella
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Believes it's on schedule. JeffP will
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turn over to ChrisC after goes to Alpha.

    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - ASHASIG
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Went to kickoff and Phac seemed a bit
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confused; to begin, he was using the
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrong schedule; also didn't make it all
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the way through the schedule during the
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meeting.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: This is an at-risk customer, has been
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meeting with Tom Rump, our internal QA
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will be critical.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: There is extensive QA built into the
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; schedule; even more important to close
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feedback loop with Rama/Musikaar after
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; review of bundled and other feedback
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; misses.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Custom ordering of reference author names
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should be applied to all sites. If we
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sample content loaded we can just look
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and see if we have a problem.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: #18 feedback pulled from GooDoc and
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; added as QA task to QuickBase; some
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reference items are noted therein.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: We should ask Greg to review and confirm
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that feedback list is complete.
    <br />
    <br />
    **ACTION: ANGIE WILL DISCUSS IN DEPTH WITH PHAC.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - neoreviews+umbrella
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: Rachel promised an update yesterday;
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; didn't provide one.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Rachel provided a verbal update that she
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expects to be code complete by 14th, as
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scheduled.

    <br />
    <br />

    7. Launch management and tracking
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Q: Do we want to keep Next_100 for launches, or
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should we find a different tool?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Directors not intending to move away from
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QB. Can we at least change the name?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Next_100 does work well for admin purposes.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; PB: We should revisit the launch process in
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; general.

  0. QA
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - Review of QA issues, discussion(s)
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; XS: We met with Ron internally last week, then with Neha/Musikaar directly. The meeting went well,
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they were open to feedback. Decided to have a&nbsp;&nbsp; call once a month or so.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  -----------------
  <br />
  1. Bundled migrations
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - Current status
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - Absentee PbMs
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - Handling feedback
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - Escalation
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Believes that all the PbMs should have released&nbsp;&nbsp; Beta sites to their customers by now.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: As a reminder, these journals were bundled for&nbsp;&nbsp; a reason: for the most part, they are customers&nbsp; who might not care as much as some others.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: A few - haematol, annalsfm, pdi - will probably&nbsp;&nbsp; be looking more closely at the sites.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS/PB: Probably worth it to confirm with PbMs that&nbsp; Betas have been released.
  <br />
  <font>
   <br />
   **ACTION: AdeV TO CONFIRM WITH PBMs TODAY.
   <font>
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Note that Ellen has done hers, also Greg.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Will set up Google Spreadsheet for addition of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; non-showstopper items.
    <br />
    <br />
    <font>
     **ACTION: PB TO SET UP GOODOC SHEET AND DISTRIBUTE TO
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ALL PARTIES (PBMs, XS, AdeV).
     <font>
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <font>
       AdeV: Will serve as PbM pro tem for Greg and LindaT; other PbMs will funnel feedback to either the&nbsp; GooDoc (for non-showstoppers) or via e-mail&nbsp; to migbundle@highwire (for showstoppers).
       <font>
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Will work with AdeV and PB to review both types&nbsp; of feedback and help escalate to directors, as&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: For any serious feedback, we *can* pull them&nbsp; out of the bundle if necessary.
        <br />

        2. Status on active migrations
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; - 3 Geo Sites launching today (econgeo, jsedres,
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; palaios); status request pending with Mahesh
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Launching tomorrow, not today. One wasn't
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; complete complete as of yesterday (palaios?).
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Will be following up with content today.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Had prelaunch meeting yesterday. One had its
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mapping scripts run yesterday. Some A/C
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problems have been resolved.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: econgeo is content complete.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: econgeo site is also ready to go.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: UPDATE DURING MEETING: econgeo, palaios are
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content complete, jsedres is 90% and should be
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100% today.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: CA should alert JD so that mapping can begin.
        <br />
        <font>
         <br />
         **ACTION: XS TO MAKE SURE CA KEEPS JD IN THE LOOP.

          <br />
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp; - 1 Geo Site launching next week; as above
          <br />
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: ssabull not yet content complete, and there&nbsp; are problems. Target date is 13 Oct; while&nbsp; the date is not in jeopardy, there is a flag.&nbsp; SMPTE has same CA as this one, so MikeM needs help; a second CA has been assigned.
          <b>
           <font>
            We won't&nbsp;&nbsp; have a 1-week cushion between content&nbsp;&nbsp; complete and go-live.

           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: Do we need to notify h2o-mig-mgmt at this&nbsp;&nbsp; point?
           <br />
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Not yet. Working VERY hard to keep target&nbsp;&nbsp; date.

             <br />
             <br />
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Phac may not realize that Xia has been loading
             <br />
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DS for all migrations all along,
             <font>

              <font>
               . She says she's fine. JeffP is
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a much bigger problem. Is hoping to find a way
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to move him off the BIR migration, at least.
               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: Do we have a project scope for this one, yet?
               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: GregS is doing the technical JD work associated
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the project; he's on top of it. PB will
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; start becoming involved on the management level,&nbsp; only.
               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: The BJR launch happens in October; 2 migrations
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and a launch in January. End of Oct launch has
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no content. A lot of meetings to date have been&nbsp; with Craig and Todd.
               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: Phac is concerned that the JD is not working
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the migrations, but that might be OK since&nbsp;&nbsp; they are going live in January.

   1. Communication with PbMs about bundled migrations
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; Summary: Some PbMs appear not to have discussed the
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bundled approach with their customers;
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; getting a &quot;head-count&quot; on that now. MPP and
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MA were not distributed to PbMs, so none of
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bundled customers have those docs as of
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; today.
   <br />
   <font>
    <br />
    AdV: got OK from PbMs, and prepared documentation was not shared. At least 1 PbM hasn't talked to the customer - so others might be aware.
    <br />
    PB: I talked to all except Dom, everybody else had given heads up to publishers.
    <br />
    Only one that weren't notified were Linda T
    <br />
    RadTech, clinMedRes, 2 publisher.

     2. Project plan for ASHA Newsletters
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; Summary: Schedule is being built, with a proposed
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; launch date of 8 December. This project
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will need a dedicated manager, either PbM
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or PjM. (Aside: Angie/Bernard have
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tentatively identified PjM.)
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; Suggested (&quot;quasi-bundled&quot;) approach:
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - no alpha sites
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - start with beta sites, pointed to prod
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - load pan-era samples to prod, subset of sites
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - QA site, features, and content, as per &quot;alpha&quot;
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - fix bugs
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - load pan-era samples to prod, all sites
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - ask Musikaar to QA content only, unless we find
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out that the sites are not &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; in
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of design/features
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - give ASHA access ~2 weeks prior to launch; ask
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them to review and finalize File Manager pages at
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that time
     <br />
     <font>
      <br />
      ashajnls beta/prod.... 100% content QA
      <br />
      will be Phac
      <br />
      GregB, X, P, A to talk today
      <br />
      #18 is the model. That told us what the important items are, ex., citation format
      <br />
      PB: to check w/Xia if the sites are really cookie cutter.
      <br />
      Pam W will take these over from Greg B (and the journals from Christine)

       3. CTSNet reality check
       <br />
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Summary: Due to the scope of the CTSNet project and
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resource (staffing) constraints, it seems
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extremely
       <b>
        <font>
         unlikely that we will be able to
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; squeeze this migration in during 2011,
        </font>
       </b>
       <font>
        even
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if CTSNet/Dom comes back with a green-light
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; next week.
        <br />
        <br />
        <font>
         <br />
         DTD transition still not scheduled.
         <br />
         Even if we find out on Oct 1, we can't get the conversion work done.

             Waiting on annual meeting.&nbsp; Dom now.
             <br />
             Moving CME (now under CTS a/c db)&nbsp; to Sage will be big deal. We'll have to bring up a new, clean OUP/Sage umbrella.
             <br />
             <br />
             CME 2.0 (i.e., BW and LH) will handle this migration better.
             <br />
             <br />
             BW: Yes, we have to wait for Dom to get the plan from them.

                         <br />
                         &nbsp;&nbsp; - headers, footers, colors only in 2011

                          GSW portal update this year
                          <br />
                          XPS: Portal is big hairy, we decided earlier to convert the portal AFTER the sites migration
                          <br />
                          BW: LT has agreement that we do the facelift (headers/ footers, colors only). Alex@GSW concern is that we'll take forever to finish the H2O version of the portal. LT told him Q2.
                          <br />
                          BUT it's all FEATURES on that portal. We have to inventory them, and think about the development work.
                          <br />
                          Needs to be Sara, b/c only she does H1O. But Lorena's brother does DTL design (seattle; see BW)

   1. Communication with PbMs about bundled migrations
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; Summary: Some PbMs appear not to have discussed the
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bundled approach with their customers;
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; getting a &quot;head-count&quot; on that now. MPP and
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MA were not distributed to PbMs, so none of
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bundled customers have those docs as of
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; today.
   <br />
   <br />
   Paul: Hasn't yet heard back from Dom, but talked to all
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other PbMs. All PbMs except for LindaT are fine.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They're aware, publishers are either OK or don't
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; care.
   <br />
   <br />
   Angie: radtech and clinmedres are LindaT's bundled
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sites; two different publishers.
   <br />
   <br />
   Bill: If PbM doesn't think MPP/MA is necessary, safe
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to skip.
   <br />
   <br />
   <b>
    <font>
     ACTION
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    : Paul and Xenia will meet with LindaT to discuss
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her concerns. Will try to keep them on the same
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; schedule, otherwise her two sites will have a
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; separate schedule.
    <br />
    <br />
    ACTION: Paul will follow up with Dom, as well.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    2. Project plan for ASHA Newsletters
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Summary: Schedule is being built, with a proposed
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; launch date of 8 December. This project
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will need a dedicated manager, either PbM
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or PjM. (Aside: Angie/Bernard have
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tentatively identified PjM.)
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Suggested (&quot;quasi-bundled&quot;) approach:
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - no alpha sites
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - start with beta sites, pointed to prod
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - load pan-era samples to prod, subset of sites
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - QA site, features, and content, as per &quot;alpha&quot;
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - fix bugs
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - load pan-era samples to prod, all sites
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - ask Musikaar to QA content only, unless we find
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out that the sites are not &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; in
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of design/features
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - give ASHA access ~2 weeks prior to launch; ask
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them to review and finalize File Manager pages at
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that time
    <br />
    <br />
    ACTION: Angie will prepare schedule.
    <br />
    <br />
    ACTION: Paul, Xenia, and Angie will meet with GregB to
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confirm this approach prior to kickoff.
    <br />
    <br />
    Paul: Also gave GregB a heads-up on this today.
    <br />
    <br />
    Xenia: Should we build time into the schedule in case
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they decide to do a major review at the end?
    <br />
    <br />
    Mark: If we &quot;match 18&quot; we'll be OK.
    <br />
    <br />
    Bill: We do have a list of the things that they really
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; care about, so we need to focus on those things
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; during QA.
    <br />
    <br />
    Bernard: Phac will be PjM.
    <br />
    <br />
    Mark: Pam will take this customer from Greg.
    <br />
    <font>
     <br />
     ACTION: Angie and Bernard will bring Phac into the loop
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; once schedule has been drafted.

      <br />
      3. CTSNet reality check
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Summary: Due to the scope of the CTSNet project and
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resource (staffing) constraints, it seems
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extremely unlikely that we will be able to
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; squeeze this migration in during 2011, even
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if CTSNet/Dom comes back with a green-light
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; next week.
      <br />
      <br />
      Angie: There are four sites involved, plus CME.
      <br />
      <br />
      Mark: Transition from Polly to Dom was announced last
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; week.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: In order to keep CME, the SAGE site needs to
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remain under CTSNet umbrella.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: Let's continue to wait on Dom's report, which he
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will need to secure from CTSNet.
      <br />
      <br />
      Mark: Dom does know that he is supposed to get this
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; info for us ASAP. Dom met with Polly on this last
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; week.
      <br />
      <br />
      Ron: Someone should follow up with Dom.
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: Mark will follow up with Dom.
      <br />
      <br />
      Mark: Is there a date by which we need to decide go/no-go?
      <br />
      <br />
      Xenia: It has already passed.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      <br />
      4. Other migration-y items of note
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 4a. AJNR had some problems; debrief?
      <br />
      <br />
      Bernard: PbM was away during a period of high activity.
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The customer contact has been very difficult
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to work with. A secondary contact at AJNR is
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more rational. Feedback has been somewhat
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arbitrary. As of today there are still some
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open items.
      <br />
      <br />
      Paul: We thought this was going to be a simple
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; migration, but ended up doing heavy customization
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the UI side. Bottleneck with Sara. Problems
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; during the launch itself. Paul set up the
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prelaunch meeting himself; PjM didn't do it.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bernard: DTL quizzes had problems as of launch day.
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: None (?)
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 4b. JBJSBR may have a resource constraint: JD
      <br />
      <br />
      Bernard: We need external validation of this; the PjM
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may not be aware of HighWire's &quot;status quo&quot;.
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The JD side should review.
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: Paul will do a sanity-check with Xia.
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 4c. ASM has a resource constraint: Sara
      <br />
      <br />
      Group: She is over-committed, &quot;totally crushed.&quot;
      <br />
      <br />
      Mark: ASM has just transitioned from Fran to Bert, but
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he has no bandwith really to do anything for ASM.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: If Sara has to do both GSW Portal and ASM File
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manager pages, which should go first? Need to
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; figure it out.
      <br />
      <br />
      Ron: GSW is H1O, so it's not as easy to hand stuff off
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to others.
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: (See #5, below.)
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 4d. AAP may have a resource constraint: Sudhanshu
      <br />
      <br />
      Ron: Craig said he would have some start/end dates for
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; us by Friday.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: Is this really that big of a project? Didn't WARP
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reveal that this wasn't a big project?
      <br />
      <br />
      Ron: It seems like we finish something, call it done,
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and then identify something else that's still
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; undone.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: Let's see what Sudhanshu says on Friday.
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: Ron will follow up with Sudhanshu.
      <br />
      <br />

      5. GSW portal work in 2011 vs 2012
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - headers, footers, colors only in 2011
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - Sara's time to do the development?
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - any other resources required from JD, CA, or PMO?
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - when do we start scoping, staffing, and scheduling
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the actual portal work?
      <br />
      <br />
      Xenia: Was told by LindaT/Margo earlier this year that
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the portal is a sizable project; for that reason
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we decided to split the journals from the portal
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and do the portal later. Not sure how/why it
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resurfaced now.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: Talked with LindaT this morning. LindaT has an
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agreement with Alix that we will do this facelift
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in 2011 (keep it in H1O for now). Alix's concern
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is &quot;the tail&quot;. Is it going to be finished in 2012?
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier? Later? LindaT is looking for a date, and
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill thinks maybe Q2 2012 is feasible. Suggested
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that she sit down with JD team to review features
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to decide how to migrate the portal next year.
      <br />
      <br />
      Paul: So we are committed to headers/footers/colors in
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2011. Has to be Sara to do the work.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bernard: Any external resources available to help?
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: Lorena's brother did &quot;stunningly marvelous&quot; work
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for us on some DTL/CME work. His name is Joe.
      <br />
      <br />
      Ron: Greg has had a conversation with LindaT already.
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: Paul will discuss Sara's schedule with GregS
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; next week.
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: Mark will follow up with LindaT for additional
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; background.
      <br />
      <br />

      6. 2012 project priorities
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - stke: in progress now?
      <br />
      <br />
      Mark: Had a meeting with AAAS yesterday. Polly is going
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to draft spec for H2O migration of STKE with a
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drupal layer on it. Should be done in ~2 weeks.
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They'll have ~2 weeks to review it.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: Tien is the PjM, and she seems to have a good
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; handle on this one. Has a good strategy. Will be
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; working on this with Polly.
      <br />
      <br />
      Mark: Polly will be doing a brain dump on AAAS with
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X (did not hear) and Christine.
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - jwatch: any updates?
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: We should find out something soon -- at least a
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; week, maybe more. Don't have a schedule, yet.
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - cme sites (mobile)
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: Two are in production, others are close to being
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in production. Sometime in 2012 we will move CME
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sites into the H2O environment. AHA is in final
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beta.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: All the rest of these fall into the same
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; category. We need to decompose all of these.
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - umbrella sites
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: Two different types: ones that &quot;just sit there&quot;
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vs those that are very functional. We need to
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make those determinations.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: PbMs should do this analysis for us.
      <br />
      <br />
      Ron: Do we have a list of umbrellas?
      <br />
      <br />
      Bernard: Margo put one together.
      <br />
      <br />
      Angie: I can include it in the meeting notes.
      <br />
      <br />
      Group: [Further discussion about umbrellas, I think.]
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: Unknown. Not sure if somebody else picked this
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up at the end of the call; it was difficult to
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hear the discussion.
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - meeting abstracts sites
      <br />
      <br />
      --Not Discussed--
      <br />
      <br />

      <br />
      <br />
      Paul: Any updates on SMPTE Standards?
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: At least two weeks late in feedback from the
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customer. They've already been told that delays
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on their side result in delays on our side.
      <br />
      <br />
      Mark: Have signed off on November launch.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bernard: Recommends talking to Tien directly.

   0. For our next PAX
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - Review of QA issues, discussion(s)
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - Planning for 2012 projects
   <br />
   <br />
   -----------------
   <br />
   1. Communication with PbMs about bundled migrations
   <br />
   <br />
   Angie: We need to pass info along to PbMs ASAP; at
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this point we don't know whether their
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customers are even available to review in
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; October.
   <br />
   <br />
   Xenia: Worst case scenario, some PbMs may not have
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; told their customers about the bundling.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Paul will walk around the office and confirm
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that customers have been made aware of
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bundled approach with each PbM directly.
   <br />
   <br />
   Xenia: Sounds like a good idea, to meet with each PbM
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; individually.
   <br />
   <br />
   Xenia: MPP/MA may not have been shared with the PbMs.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If they have not been received by the customers,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do we want to deliver those now or not?
   <br />
   <br />
   Angie: Suggests asking a &quot;safe&quot; PbM if they ever
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received the MPP/MA for the bundles; if so,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great, if not, bring to afternoon meeting
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with Bill.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Xenia will talk to Ellen about MPP/MA.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Angie to add to 2pm agenda.
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
   -----------------
   <br />
   2. Project plan for ASHA Newsletters
   <br />
   <br />
   Angie: Need to finalize launch date and schedule.
   <br />
   <br />
   Xenia: If we don't have a dedicated PjM or PbM, then
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as we did for the other bundles we could have
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a combo of JD/CA to manage it, potentially. If
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we take that approach, we'll need a separate
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CA to manage the content side.
   <br />
   <br />
   Paul: JD side doesn't have staff available to manage
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the site side. Needs to go back to Mark or Ron.
   <br />
   <br />
   Paul: Staging site is on a production cluster. It's
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pointing to prod DB, and is essentially live.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has to be instantiated very close to production
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because we can't make changes on a daily basis.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We set them up ~2 weeks prior to migration. Main
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; benefit of staging site is that it goes faster
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than Beta.
   <br />
   <br />
   Paul: If this customer doesn't really care about
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speed, maybe we just don't do Staging sites.
   <br />
   <br />
   Paul: Suggested approach:
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - no alpha sites
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - start with beta sites, pointed to prod
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - load pan-era samples to prod, subset of sites
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - QA site, features, and content, as per &quot;alpha&quot;
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - fix bugs
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - load pan-era samples to prod, all sites
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - ask Musikaar to QA content only, unless we
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; find out that the sites are not &quot;cookie-cutter&quot;
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in terms of design/features
   <br />
   <br />
   Xenia: Sounds good.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Angie to draft schedule using this info.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Angie to identify PjM with Bernard.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Angie to include on 2pm agenda.
   <br />
   <br />
   Paul: Appear to be generated sites; will double-check
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with H1O JD (Xiaoya?). They appear to have a
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shared set of FM pages, so if we convert them
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and pass them along to ASHA ~2 weeks should be
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fine.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Paul to double-check with Xiaoya (?).
   <br />
   <br />
   -----------------
   <br />
   3. Make clear to mgmt that CTSNet won't complete in
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 2011, even if customer decision re: whether to
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; retain umbrella happens in early October
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Angie to include on 2pm agenda.
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
   -----------------
   <br />
   4. Status on active migrations
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - AJNR launched yesterday: no notification, many
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open feedback items remain; Mahesh queried
   <br />
   <br />
   Paul: Had to schedule pre-launch meeting for Mahesh;
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lots of open items at that time; sounds like it
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; took ~2 hours to migrate the site, which may
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mean something went wrong.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Angie will include on 2pm agenda, and will
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continue to track with Mahesh/Bernard.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - JAAHA appears to be launching today
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - lots of open items for 3 of 4 &quot;Geo Sites&quot;
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (jsedres, palaios, ssabull); Mahesh queried
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Angie will continue to track with Mahesh.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - ASHS: any news?
   <br />
   <br />
   Paul: Very straightforward, very little feedback, no
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problems at all. Pan-era QA is complete. One
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bug is still open. Overall in good shape.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - next bundle milestone: to customers on 4 Oct
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: See above.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - ORTHO pan-era qa: haven't located GooDoc so
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cannot determine whether project is ready to
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; load; anybody have further info, otherwise I
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will query LindaA today
   <br />
   <br />
   Paul: Has access to the spreadsheet; will forward to
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PAX. Believes that sign-off came in this AM,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but there are still some content QA items that
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; need to be resolved
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - JBJSBR resource constraint: JD; will try to find
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out today whether Phac will be notifying
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h2o-mig-mgmt
   <br />
   <br />
   Xenia: There was a JBJSBR meeting yesterday, to cover
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not just the migration but the launches. There
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will be a Drupal element for parent site. Todd
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Craig were there. The Xia/JD problem did
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not come up. Timeline discussed.
   <br />
   <br />
   Paul: GregS is also involved; he may know what's going
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Angie to follow up with Phac/Bernard.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - ASH may have missed pan-era qa; not seeing any
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; findings on the GooDoc; Mahesh queried
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Angie to follow up with Mahesh.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - ASM resource constraint: Sara; Ron has been
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alerted, not yet a crisis, not jeopardizing
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any milestones, but customer a bit frustrated
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - AJS goes to beta next week; Mahesh queried
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Angie to follow up with Mahesh.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - GSW: any news?
   <br />
   <br />
   Xenia: Content side seems OK; deadline of today for
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sign-off for content loading.
   <br />
   <br />
   Paul: Not many bugs left on the site side.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - annalsfm
   <br />
   <br />
   Xenia: Still in the bundle?
   <br />
   <br />
   Paul: Did talk to Greg Brown about this; shouldn't
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; need to take it out of the bundle; some design
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes can be accommodated as part of the
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; project.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Xenia, Paul, Angie will meet with Greg to
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discuss this and his other bundled sites.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - AACC (clinchem): hoping to make PjM assignment
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this week; Jean still working on installables;
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customer meeting scheduled for tomorrow
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Angie to work with Bernard on PjM assignment.
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
   ---DID NOT DISCUSS---
   <br />
   <br />

   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - BIR: well in hand with Gregory
   <br />

   <br />
   <br />
   -----------------
   <br />
   5. GSW portal work in 2011 vs 2012
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - headers, footers, colors only in 2011
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - Sara's time to do the development?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - any other resources required from JD,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CA, or PMO?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - when do we start scoping, staffing,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and scheduling the actual portal work?
   <br />
   <br />
   -----------------
   <br />
   6. Citation errors for Duke project
   <br />

   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; would it make sense to ask Rama to return to
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PjM meeting to discuss QA, with so many new
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PjMs on board? AdeV will speak with Rama and
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bernard about that
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Meeting happened with Neha, XS didn't
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attend but did circulate a list of
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; high-level items that we'd like to tune
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up with Musikaar; Neha was going to take
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; back to India and then get back to HWP.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: AdeV to follow up with Rama re: use of
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; checklists, and with Bernard/Rama about
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possible benefits of having another QA
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; session with PjMs.

   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; we are going to bundle
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; we need to build QA into the schedule
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: AdeV to finish up schedule and circulate to

   1. ASHA newsletters: to bundle or not to bundle?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; would it trouble (or anger) them if we bundle,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the sense that they may not trust us right
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now, and may wish to check our work as we go?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; do we please them by &quot;doing all the work&quot; by
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bundling?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; shall we ask ASHA their preference, or make the
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decision internally?
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: A draft schedule is now pending with Angie.
   <br />
   <br />
   BW: There was on a call with ASHA today.
   <b>
    <font>
     They don't
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; want to look at anything, ever; they want us to
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get everything 100% correct, and if we don't then
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we're doing it wrong.
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    <br />
    <br />
    RL: Sounded like he expects it to look exactly the
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; same on H2O as it does on H1O.
    <br />
    <br />
    BW: It's not so much the fonts and styling, as much
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the individual bits of content that need to
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look the same, be positioned in the same way as
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as on H1O. The things that ASHA is most
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; concerned about are:
    <b>
     <font>
      author display, title
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; display, section names. Structure.
     </font>
    </b>
    <font>
     <br />
     <br />
     XS: Is a content briefing required here?
     <br />
     <br />
     BW: ASHA gave us a list of things that we need to
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; correct in #18 (launch) before we go live
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tomorrow. If we can solve everything in #18 to
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASHA's satisfaction, we should be able to go
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forward with migration. If HWP sees anything not
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on ASHA's list, we need to call them out for ASHA.
     <br />
     <br />
     XS: Are 1-16 cookie-cutter?
     <br />
     <br />
     BW: Yes. #17 (live) and #18 (pending) are now higher
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; visibility, and ASHA doesn't like what they're
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seeing, so we're going back in to address
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problems on both sites.
     <br />
     <br />
     MK: We are talking about a bundled approach.
     <br />
     <br />
     MJ: This does make it easier for ASHA to pin a
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;failure&quot; on HWP.
     <br />
     <br />
     XS: Few eras, not much content.
     <br />
     <br />
     BW: Yes, bundled approach. ASHA wants it to be done
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100% accurately.
     <br />
     <br />
     MK: Can the when be in January?
     <br />
     <b>
      <font>

      </font>
     </b>

       2. CTSNet: to migrate or not to migrate?
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; Directors appear to have decided to go ahead
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the migration in the absence of a firm
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; commitment
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; PbM (Polly) has strong reservations
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; has no official PjM at this time, but Angie is
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trying to keep moving it forward
       <br />
       <br />
       BW: CTSNet is split in three, now: two are proceeding,
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just no decision about the umbrella and which
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't. The one that's gone to SAGE is in progress.
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three that have gone to OUP are in progress.
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining journals are not in progress. What
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we do with the umbrella or not has not been
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decided.
       <br />
       <br />
       BH: Polly indicates that after annual meeting (in
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; late Sep 2011), we may have more clarity.
       <br />
       <br />
       MJ: Louise covering for Polly, but CTSNet will go to
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dom.
       <br />
       <br />
       BW: CTSNet does need to give us their decisions on
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the umbrella, the associations between the sites,
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the feature set, etc.
       <br />
       <br />
       AdeV: Reminder that two of the CTSNet sites come to
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; us in the Elsevier DTD, will require a custom
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XSL transform, work has begun but is not yet
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; complete. Also, the SAGE journal is currently
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; part of the larger CTSNet launch set, and does
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not have a migration date, yet.
       <br />
       <br />
       BW: How to move forward with that title is a question
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for Bert/SAGE.
       <br />
       <br />
       MJ: Thinks that we should allow CTSNet to have their
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; annual meeting, and that Dom should follow up
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with them after that.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp; some that we should cover:
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; RSMP
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problematic projects so they can be added to

                    <br />
                    9. should we continue to talk about how doing DTD
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; transitions during migrations can trip us up?

                    10. what is being done to improve the QA and feedback
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; process?

                    <br />
                    BW: Did somebody agree to ask Niz to make a personal

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call to Neha/Musikaar; did that happen?

                    <br />
                    AdeV: I don't believe so.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    RL: Neha is in town this week; let's set up a meeting.

   1. ASHA newsletters
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; needs new target date
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; bundle it?
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: They are probably going to see some of their
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sites. They are being picky and maybe even
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unreasonable re: their H2O launches, which
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have not gone well.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: So it's a bundle in terms of the work we have
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to do, but we will ask customer to review.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe we stagger QA feedback from them? Maybe
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they'll feel better as we go?
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: HWP message is that we'll be done migrating
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all journals by the end of 2011. If that
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; approach means spilling into 2012...
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: If that approach makes the customer less
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; likely to leave...
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Xia has already done a substantial amount of
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work, so we're in good shape even now.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Perhaps we can frame these as &quot;newsletters&quot;
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rather than &quot;journals&quot;.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Didn't send out alerts in May, quarterly
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; journal, alerts had never been worked on,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when they did finally go out they were
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; labelled &quot;hwmaint&quot;. Another project has been
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with a JD for months, they're unhappy about
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: What's the action? Make a schedule and then
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; talk to directors?
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Yes, schedule first. Maybe have them looking
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at a subset of three.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: Wants someone like MarkJ to chime in.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Perhaps this is a question for the customer,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to ask them how they'd like to work with us.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: AdeV will (A) generate draft schedule, building
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in assumption that we will Beta 3 sites to ASHA
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rather than going full-on bundle; (B) forward
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; schedule to Bill and Greg Brown to give them a
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sense of what our timeline is; (C) ask them to
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help us decide whether to do standard Beta or
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to bundle, perhaps by asking ASHA to comment on
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their preferred approach.

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: LindaT tends to feel that all of her pubs
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are nitpicky and tends to support that
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tendency; she doesn't like to push back.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the volume of content for GSW, that
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free-handed approach raises a red flag. We
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may want to talk to Bill about this.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Perhaps we should spend time with Ellen and
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; take it to Bill -before- involving LindaT.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: XS will do feedback review with Ellen, then
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; raise any concerns with Bill. Will invite PB
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the pre-Bill discussion in case there are
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; site-level feedbacks.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Maybe Paul can step in on the site side in
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a more detailed way. What's our plan for
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; site-level feedback?
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Was also in yesterday's GSW meeting; sounds
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like feedback may be more on the content,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; less on the site side. We do need to
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strategize site approach. MK agrees.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: PB will work with Ellen to help determine when,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what, staging sites, content sites, plan of
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attack, making sure we have things in place at
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the right times.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Is the site strategy a launch-day issue?
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: No, we need to have a coordinated approach
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throughout the project; we need to plan and
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; implement. For Duke we did not create
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; staging sites until content was loaded.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Suggested that MikeM and Ellen work together
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to come up with a more detailed plan for
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content loading (right now it's a 6-week
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; black box). This may tie in with site plan.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be loading content in waves.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Creating a staging site is like creating a
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beta site pointed to prod. Publisher won't
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; see it until it's given to them.
   <br />

   SUMMARY: &quot;Bolstering Ellen on GSW&quot; means that
   <b>
    <font>
     Xenia,
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul, Margo, Angie, Bernard need to take a
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more active role
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    than usual to define the
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; next phases of the project, to keep the
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feedback response reasonable, to keep the
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PbM and customer working together with us
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toward migration (vs &quot;polishing&quot; the sites).

    5. ATS
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; potentially moving from Mahesh to Ellen,
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assuming that we are able to bolster her
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; efforts on GSW
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: This one has moved to Ellen. We had a
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prekickoff last week, without JD, some
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; groundwork has been laid; the true
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kickoff will happen today; Angie and
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mahesh will drive while Ellen comes up
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to speed. No red flags yet.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Did we get an H1O analysis from Karen?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: Yep, we did.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Will be on the call; MK needn't attend.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Rachel is estimating 2 weeks worth of work;
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; could morph into something larger. Has not
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had a chance to speak with her, yet. John
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haggerty is on vacation next week. Soon, Ann
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will be on board.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: The VJ portion is an isolated piece; maybe
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we need to do the less desirable thing and
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turn site over with out VJ piece.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Yes, is it not possible for us to get the
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; site/content ready and through alpha while
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we wait on VJ piece? Sounds like we could
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; almost do that now.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: Yes, alpha prep is substantially complete,
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but it's been substantially complete for
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; months, wit
    <b>
     <font>
      h no ETA on the VJ piece.

    </b>
    <font>
     Not
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keen on asking the project team to pick
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this back up again without a firm
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; commitment from the developers (Rachel and
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ron, specifically) re: when the VJ piece
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will be ready. Doesn't want to beta the
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; site with AAP before VJ piece is ready.
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beta currently scheduled for the week of
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oct 17. Alpha currently scheduled for the
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weeks of 3 and 10 Oct.
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Agrees that it would be better to beta with
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AAP with VJ in place. Shouldn't give AAP a
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; migration date until we know when VJ piece
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will be complete.
     <br />
     <br />
     ACTION: MK will follow up with Rachel to see if she
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can commit to VJ completeness on or before
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 Oct.

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: Still on schedule, Mahesh/PubSpec now
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; working with ASH on date confirmation,
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Polly confirms that we should go with
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; design #2 (no ASH input requested) and
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a simple porting of their existing
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; umbrella. Red flags slowly lowering on
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this one.
     <br />
     <br />
     ACTION: AdeV will query Mahesh and PbM Pro Tem for
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) ASH confirmation of beta review dates, and
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) receipt of alpha feedback.

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; redirect or an actual migration?
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; AdeV to follow up with Bert

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; ...and all the rest...
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; can/should we bundle any of them together?
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; * aacr virtual journals: urgency? plan?
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; Ron is asking whether we should convene the
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; developers to begin planning our approach, but
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is that more of a question for the directors,
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.e. to help establish priorities?
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; * books: urgency? plan?
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; which book sites should migrate first,
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; potentially setting the stage for the rest?
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; is gcssepmproc an H2O book site launch?
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; are the ersjnls actually book sites?

     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: gcssepmproc is an H2O book launch; the
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ersjnls do have one H2O book. We have
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~5 H2O books already, but they were
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not migrated. Don't forget SMPTE!
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; * meeting abstracts: urgency? plan?
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; can/should we bundle any of them together?
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; is chestmtg happening, or did they leave HWP?

  1.&nbsp; Critical updates / decisions
  <br />
  <br />
  1a. ASHA Journals: any change in status?
  <br />
  <br />
  1b. ASHA Newsletters: migrate to H2O to manage maint
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; burden going forward, even though the journals may
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be leaving HWP?
  <br />
  <br />
  * update tomorrow
  <br />
  <br />
  1c. NeoReviews: migration continues to be delayed due
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to complexities surrounding Virtual Journal work.
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current &quot;draft&quot; schedule has the site going live on
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H2O on Thursday, 8 Dec.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  * needs RS for two weeks.
  <br />
  - Not sure if can wait for Oct 6 Ann V., plus training.
  <br />
  - John H booked for Linda T
  <br />
  - Sudhanshu is doing VJ service (making it available in atom store)

   1d. GSW (mid November):
   <b>
    <font>
     red flag
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    on this one due to the concurrent
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nlm transitions of ~10 child sites in combination
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the forthcoming ~2-week absence of the PjM.
    <br />
    <br />
    PB: Transition issue itself is in migration QA, as has happened with biolbull, ajnr, protocols
    <br />
    PB: MM is really concerned, re: ? set 5 of GSW.
    <br />
    BW: Ellen - going on vacation - is responsible for GSW *and* transitions.
    <br />
    <br />
    MK: Not sure chris c and Mike p know what to do. For Duke &quot;Staging&quot; was talked about, but ET did not internalize.&nbsp; In the 11th hour we had only content sites.
    <br />
    <br />
    PB: PB and XPS should always be sitting in on these GSW migration meetings.
    <br />
    <br />
    Michael Graham is pub specialist
    <br />
    <br />
    AdV TO TALK TO ET TODAY re: where the schedule
    <br />
    <font>
     <br />
     1e. ClinChem: migrate as-is (with gappy, old retro) or&nbsp; continue to hold off while the customer decides
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what they want to do with that old stuff?
     <br />
     <br />
     BW: Thought I said we should move forward as it.&nbsp; Tell Jean.
     <br />
     <br />
     1f. CTSNet: have they entered into a new agreement?
     <br />
     AdV: On hold, per PS w/o agreement.
     <br />
     BW: Euro journals have all 3 gone to OUP. One has gone to Sage. Remaining couple have not resigned, but have indicated they will.
     <br />
     AdV: Custom XSLT work here, bigger than normal
     <br />
     <br />
     <br />
     1g. ACLS: still on hold?
     <br />
     AdV: Editor died, not sure if it will continue.
     <br />
     <br />
     1h. AACR VJs: possible Drupal solution?
     <br />
     MK: 2 vj's cancer research online, and another one.
     <br />
     Now that Sp has a VJ solution, we can use that. But these will be very custom. Their TOCs are drawn from external journals.
     <br />
     BW:&nbsp; Drupal team is backlogged for 6 months
     <br />
     MK: There is content on these sites as well
     <br />
     We need to get Greg and Rachel together and figure what the implementation strategy might be
     <br />
     <br />
     <br />
     1i. MMS: any change in status?
     <br />
     BW:&nbsp; We have 60 pages of questions to answer. Then a presentation in September.
     <br />
     <br />
     <font>
      1j. Bloodbook (&quot;Edbook&quot;), and umbrella
      <br />
      MK: Darcy and Polly not involved much. Fran now. No direction from Publisher re: expectation for site. Blood migration was not cookie cutter.&nbsp; Date is &quot;firm&quot; Nov 2. No publisher guidance.
      <br />
      Fran and Mahesh are 10 days new. We need someone to shadow Mahesh, and we need someone on the project side.
      <br />
      MJ: Laura Paterson is backing Fran up on ASH.
      <br />
      <br />
      PB: Portal/umbrella is important to them.

          3a. Should we consider instituting a new dist list to
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which PjMs (and others) submit schedule changes, so
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that all relevant parties hear about such things consistently?
          <br />
          pb, mk, xps, bw, mj, rl, adv, bh,
          <br />
          MK says one of those five dates displaying in the date report.&nbsp; ....
          <br />
          &quot;Problem and at risk/missed dates;&nbsp; date changes.

           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other critical items not known until they force a&nbsp; schedule slip?

   <br />
   <br />
   -------
   <br />
   1a. ASHA Journals: any change in status?
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Tom and Greg Brown are meeting with ASHA
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tomorrow.
   <br />
   <br />
   -------
   <br />
   1b. ASHA Newsletters: migrate to H2O to manage maint
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; burden going forward, even though the journals may
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be leaving HWP?
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: This has been on hold for a while; we will need
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to change the launch date out from 27 Sep.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BW: Reassess following outcome of tomorrow's ASHA
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meeting.
   <br />
   <br />
   -------
   <br />
   1c. NeoReviews: migration continues to be delayed due
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to complexities surrounding Virtual Journal work.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current &quot;draft&quot; schedule has the site going live on
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H2O on Thursday, 8 Dec.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RL: Can this wait until Ann Van is back?
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Not sure we should wait 4-6 weeks on this.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BW: We should ask Rachel to reassess and if she
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; won't have time herself, maybe she can hand it
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; off to someone else.
   <br />
   <br />

       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sure his part is nearly done. cc: MK and RL.
       <br />
       <br />
       -------
       <br />
       1d. GSW: red flag on this one due to the concurrent nlm
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transitions of ~10 child sites in combination with
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the forthcoming ~2-week absence of the PjM.
       <br />

       </a>
       <br />
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Until recently, lack of NLM transition was a
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gating factor for migration; NLM trans not done
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meant migration date not set.
       <br />
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Transition and migration QA is all mixed up.
       <br />
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Are there some efficiencies in doing multiple at
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; once that we're not taking advantage of?
       <br />
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Another red flag is on the site side, not sure
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the JDs know what they need to do next.
       <br />
       <br />
       <font>
        ACTION
        <font>
         : BW will touch base with Mike to find out what
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his perspective is on this, how we might smooth
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this out and make it more feasible.

           <br />
           -------
           <br />
           1e. ClinChem: migrate as-is (with gappy, old retro) or
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continue to hold off while the customer decides
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what they want to do with that old stuff?
           <br />
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BW: We should go forward with this as-is.

               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BW: Yes, still on hold.

               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: We may be able to use some of Sudhanshu's AAP
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VJ work for this project, but it's going to be
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even more custom.
               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BW: Drupal was selected for stke because it's
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; really not a journal site, and is more easily
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; supported in Drupal than straight H2O.
               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Suggests that we discuss these two sites with
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greg, Sudhanshu, Rachel, and others to decide
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how to proceed.

               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BW: No change in status, although HWP is preparing

   2. Invite Rama to these meetings?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - everybody clear on bundled QA needs/plan?

   &nbsp;&nbsp; - schedule slips have impact on QA
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - not all PjMs utilizing all phases of QA?
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Could be a vehicle for communicating with Rama.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe circulate agenda to him, so he can see
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when there are QA items, or add QA items to the

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; issue
   <br />
   &nbsp; -&gt; content for SIG17 (previous launch) was

   * AdeV: check in with Christine on NeoReviews
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (may not be migrated as a virtual journal;
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internal meeting may be needed to figure
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out how to do it on H2O): DONE
   <br />
   &nbsp; -&gt; Christine has queried AAP about the site's
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; current setup and the business needs behind
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it
   <br />
   &nbsp; -&gt; Christine and Margo have both suggested that
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we arrange a meeting with perhaps Todd and
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig to discuss once AAP has responded
   <br />
   <br />
   * MK: check in with Ellen on ASHS to figure out
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what's happening (releasing 3 Beta sites on
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9/06 is not feasible)
   <br />
   <br />
   * MK: set up a meeting with Paul and Rama to
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discuss QA of the bundled sites
   <br />
   <br />
   * AdeV: check in with Mahesh on bloodbook
   <br />
   <br />
   * AdeV: check in with Mahesh to confirm that he
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; knows what to do next for AJS
   <br />
   <br />
   * AdeV: check in with Bernard to discuss whether we
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can add a PjM mentor for Mahesh to ATS, or
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether we might want to staff it with a
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more senior PjM
   <br />
   <br />
   --&gt;IMPORTANT: ATS is supposed to kickoff this week.
   <br />
   <br />
   * ALL: We should discuss status of AACR VJs with
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the directors in two weeks. MK wonders if
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there might be a Drupal solution for these
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two. Question for Todd, Craig. We think it
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; needs to move out, Q1 or Q2 of 2012.
   <br />
   <br />
   * XS: check in with Jean, Bill on clinchem
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (no PjM, Retro project in play)

   <br />
   &nbsp; a last minute thought
   <br />
   <br />
   -&gt; MK will work with PaulB to beef up JD docs
   <br />
   -&gt; AdeV will add to Schedule in the form of a TASK
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; to review alerts, need to know when
   <br />
   <br />
   * Insufficient QA - need examples - perhaps
   <br />
   &nbsp; something just to watch out for
   <br />
   <br />
   * Inappropriate QA - tons of feedback from Musikaar
   <br />
   &nbsp; that is irrelevant, especially for developers
   <br />
   <br />
   * Not adhering to &quot;beta points to prod&quot; dates -
   <br />
   &nbsp; confusion that all prod content must be loaded -
   <br />
   &nbsp; must keep to our 2 week minimum window
   <br />
   <br />
   -&gt; MK to follow up with PaulB/JDs
   <br />
   <br />
   * Milestone dates, represented in the date report
   <br />
   &nbsp; are sometimes not accurate
   <br />
   <br />
   -&gt; AdeV reports that Bernard has recently
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; reminded the PjM group of this
   <br />
   <br />
   * Informs experience: - content assessment only
   <br />
   &nbsp; happened on sample content of 3 sites - more
   <br />
   &nbsp; complete content analysis needed
   <br />
   <br />
   -&gt; AdeV will bring this up at the next PjM meeting
   <br />
   <br />
   * OM content - insufficient sample QA leading to
   <br />
   &nbsp; reloading
   <br />
   <br />
   * Migration delays - both due to our delays as well
   <br />
   &nbsp; as customers requesting delays for reasons that
   <br />
   &nbsp; should have been known earlier

    <br />
    Here are some ideas for today's check-in:
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    1a. Bundling migration launch sets
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- haematol, wildlifedis, telos, ajev, jaoa,
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jaapl, jabfp, annalsfm, mycologia, pdi,
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; poultsci, japr, radtech will be bundled
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for target launch dates of 18 and 19 Oct
    <br />
    TARGET: 18, 19 Oct
    <br />
    <br />
    <font>
     AdV: still need to craft communication w/customer, etc.
     <br />
     NOW: 18th and 20th October
     <br />
     MK: maybe move hortsci a week early.
     <br />
     <br />
     AdV: I'll review the doc's and edit to make them applicable
     <br />
     <font>
      <br />
      1b. Should we use modified QuickStart/MPP/MA
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; docs for bundled migrations, should we
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; develop a new base set of migration docs for
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bundled projects, or will we no longer
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; require completion of migration launch sets
      <br />
      <br />
      <font>
       MK: We'll give them access to the beta site when we cut to prod, b/c they have to edit FM pages, etc.
       <br />
       <br />
       <font>
        <br />
        <br />
        2.&nbsp; Migration launch set date changes
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <font>
         -- ascb (x2 sites)[customer motivated]: 23 Aug
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- ortho [2 wk, customer req]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25 Oct
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- bloodbook+umbrella [cust; w/umbrella]:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 Nov
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- bir (x3 sites)[up by 1 week, to get away from holiday; P&lt;P in Oct]:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7 Dec
         <br />
         <font>
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          3.&nbsp; Inventories of non-journal sites that still
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; need to be migrated, including:
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- virtual journals&nbsp; and KEs (SAGE)
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- umbrellas (10?) and portals
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- cme sites (14)
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- books sites (OUP books; aacr redbook; aap redbook; asco ed book; etc)
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- meeting abstracts ()
          <br />
          <font>
           <br />
           BW: We need to schedule these in the first half of 2012.&nbsp; Need Books Infrastructure first.
           <br />
           CME needs to get rid of XML.&nbsp; CME Mobile is hacked, needs to get it off DTL and onto Drupal.
           <br />
           <br />
           XPS: Two major project after migrations are done:
           <br />
           1) Getting rid of H10 dependencies.
           <br />
           2) OM to FM (High def) migration.&nbsp; Finish in 2012.
           <br />
           <br />
           <br />
           MK: need to have meetings about all of these; OUP books,
           <b>
            <font>
             JWatch
            </font>
           </b>
           <font>
            ,
            <br />
            <br />
            MK: for SMPTE, we should be loading conferences in H2O.
            <br />
            BW: key for meeting abstracts is we don't have appropriate metadata at the issue level (ex., titles, sponsor, days of week, location
            <br />
            BW: also, issues with huge # of articles is problem. 2400 articles kills log.

   <br />
   * will create aacredbook launch set
   <br />
   * will create launch sets for all items in #2, below

   <br />
   * will discuss items in #4 during today's 2:00 call
   <br />
   <br />
   Additions and corrections are welcome.
   <br />
   <br />
   Thanks,
   <br />
   Angie

   -----------------
   <br />
   Angie de Villiers
   <br />
   Project Manager
   <br />
   HighWire Press
   <br />
   <br />
   -----------------
   <br />
   1. aacredbook
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - launch set #222 has too many site codes in it
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - cro/cpc should be removed, and a new launch set
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should be created
   <br />
   <br />
   Xenia: Launch set has been created.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - aacrmtg should be removed, and a new launch set
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should be created
   <br />
   <br />
   Margo: Let's discuss along with other mtg sites.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - aacredbook should be removed, and a new launch
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set should be created
   <br />
   <br />
   Angie: Still needs a launch set.
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
   -----------------
   <br />
   2. meeting sites and H2O
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - AHA: circmtg, hypermtg, strokemtg
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - chestmtg (probably not)
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - jbjsbrproc (already scheduled)
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - ashmtg
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - aacrmtg
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - ardmtg
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - jnumedmtg
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - ascomtg
   <br />
   <br />
   Angie: Will create launch sets for these.
   <br />
   <br />
   Margo: We need to determine H2O approach for these
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; migrations; Kathryn is planning to bring the
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <font>
    jbjsbrproc question to WARP,
    <font>
     and it will lead
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the way for other meeting sites. We might be
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; able to bundle multiple mtg sites into a
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; limited number of launch sets, but we don't
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know that, yet.
     <br />
     <br />
     Margo: ascomtg is unique in that the site is an H2O
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; site, but the content has not been migrated.
     <br />
     <br />
     <br />
     -----------------
     <br />
     3. September target date tango
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - bloodbook
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - mycologia
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - annalsfm
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - pdi
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - ortho/haematol
     <br />
     <br />
     <br />
     -----------------
     <br />
     4. Prep for 2pm call
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - discussion of proposed September-&gt;November
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - ASHA/ASHASIG migration must stay in September
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but do not have a PjM; Xia on the JD side but
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she is highly tasked; CA not yet assigned but
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not expected to be a problem; maybe Phac can
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; take this on instead of ATS; ATS may then need
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to move out accordingly; GregB should continue
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to work on new site launch
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - meeting sites have not yet been scheduled
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - virtual journals (cro/cpc) have yet to be
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scheduled; some KEs are in this position, as
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well (e.g. bonekey)
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - some umbrellas and portals still need to be
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; migrated: OUP, AACR, others?
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - cme sites still need to be migrated
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - books sites still need to be migrated
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - explore the possibility of lumping some of the
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smaller projects together to gain efficiencies
     <br />
     <br />
     <br />
     -----------------
     <br />
     5. Virtual Journals
     <br />
     <br />
     Margo: There will be some non-trivial XSL work at
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the service layer for Rachel to do, per
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eileen (and Sudhanshu)

  AB: What does Product Management own.
  <br />
  -Demo's are lead by PD.
  <br />
  -release/deployment (Dharm; or part of quarterly site redeploy)
  <br />
  <br />
  RL was PDM at ...
  <br />
  <br />
  AB:
  <br />
  * PDM doesn't know who all the parties needed are.
  <br />
  * And we can't schedule across the organization.
  <br />
  tin cupping doesn't work for matt. Needs a technical person.
  <br />
  <br />
  MC: Matt shouldn't be project managing engineering. It's been problematic.
  <br />
  - BMJ relaunch, or jbjs, or stke, .... these big ones, distributed across the organization, and require a PjM.&nbsp; BH has done a critical job for BMJ, according to TM. That's where the PJMs should focus
  <br />
  <br />
  For NORMAL stuff, like the Roadmap stuff, even if it doesn't fit 100% into one area or another. HOWEVER, *most* of the thins are pretty easy to say &quot;this is 90% CJ and 10% RS&quot;.&nbsp; Those projects shold be managed by CJ in this case, and work with PRD and RS and making sure they're in sync.&nbsp; That way we dn't defocus PjMs from big ticket items.&nbsp; It's CJ's job to get it done, w/RS's component. If RS isn't coming thru, Cj escalates to MC and RL.
  <br />
  <br />
  AB: Development portion of project management,... PDM can monitor to-market dates, testing, etc. And farm the development portion out to a technical expert owner.
  <br />
  <br />
  MC: My program managers are going to help CJ and TM - PGMs will birddog that for others.&nbsp; TM or CJ chases Rachel. I'll hold theier feet to the fire.
  <br />
  <br />
  RL: MK manages 24 people, Greg does 8. RS will not management.&nbsp; I don't know if I'd hew to this model.&nbsp; I have 2 people for q1/q2...
  <br />
  <br />
  RL: I can't be symmetrical with what MC suggest, I don't have free PJM cycles.
  <br />
  <br />
  BH: important&nbsp; issues:
  <br />
  * grey area. between 90% proj and
  <br />
  <br />
  AB: my staff does not have the skill set to manage developers directly.
  <br />
  MC: you need to worry about requirements, and the release, and the date for release. In the middle it's SDLC stuff.
  <br />
  <br />
  RL: I also have an ask for a PGM for resource management.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  MC: HW has an endemic lack of knowledge - technical specific. The requests come in, and the projects arehanded off, and no value is added. We haven't refined, focused, clarified beforeit went forward.
  <br />
  <br />
  prod, pulisher questions. I codl allocate 1FTE as a go between PBMs and Engineering.
  <br />
  <br />
  We lack the whole &quot;technical support&quot; layer most companies have. Our &quot;support&quot; is the PBMs, i.e., there is no technical support.
  <br />
  We should turn publication specialists, and in Ron's group have a real technical support org's.
  <br />
  <br />
  AB: Piloting comes after development and before release. And it requires direct customer contact.

  H2O lessons learning meetings 9/16/2011
  <br />
  <br />
  <font>
   <br />
   Attending: BW, XPS, AdeV, BH, MK, PB
   <br />
   <br />
   Purpose: General debrief of recent migration process, and search for practical improvements
   <br />
   <br />
   (Items assigned to &quot;PxM&quot; will be actioned by AdV; &quot;CA&quot; by XPS; )
   <br />
   <br />
   ===============================================================
   <br />
   Example 1) alerts going out with hwmaint.*� domain
   <br />
   <br />
   Problem source: complacency, over allocation of resources
   <br />
   <br />
   Improvement: adherence to process
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION:
   <br />
   ��� * be sure team sticks to the published migration schedule &amp; project plan� (PxM)
   <br />
   ������� - keep referring to schedule &amp; project plan at weekly team meetings
   <br />
   ��� * create checklist to accompany JD documentation, and require signoff (PB)
   <br />
   <br />
   ==============================================================
   <br />
   Example 2a) Content reload b/c of items missed in QA
   <br />
   <br />
   ��� ACTION: increase thoroughness or scope of QA (RC)
   <br />
   <br />
   Example 2b) Content reload b/c of items reported in QA, but not actioned before prod content loading begins
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION:
   <br />
   ��� * Early in-person meeting with JD and CL to insure every item on the feedback lists is owned (PxM)
   <br />
   ��� * Escalation of any feedback items for whom the owner is not clear (PxM)
   <br />
   ��� * Final review meeting at the moment the CA is ready to start prod loading (CA)
   <br />
   ��� * Add to the QA template a column for &quot;prereq for prod content&quot;, for completion by the CA (JN; then CA)
   <br />
   <br />
   Example 2c) Content reload b/c display work lagged content work, and content work pressed ahead
   <br />
   ��� * Have faith in machine capacity - was 1000 issues/day peak last year. So delay the load if needed, but leave time for rework
   <br />
   <br />
   ======================================================================
   <br />
   Example 3) Customer expectation run wild
   <br />
   <br />
   Problem source: early expectations set very high; HW not good at tightening the screws; market issues; abdication of responsibility by PbMs
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTIONS:
   <br />
   ��� * solutions are case-by-case.
   <br />
   ��� * Customers at risk of going out-of-control (i.e., obsessing too much on minor details during reviews) may need high-level customer management meetings (ex., GSW, ATS) No formal recommendations re: approach or ownership, everyone should stay aware at a high level.

    ===========================================================
    <br />
    LIVE NOTES
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Examples:
    <br />
    ASAH alert went out with HW Maint
    <br />
    LEsson: shouldn't be put off to the end; and we were rush; and QA didn't touch the alerts,&nbsp; [missing QA item]
    <br />
    <br />
    * Are we sticking to the checklists, schedules, items;
    <font>
     complacency
     <font>
      [adherence to process]
      <br />
      <b>
       <font>
        <br />
        1. CHECKLISTS / SCHEDULES
        <br />
        <br />
        + It should be up to the PxM to make sure the checklist is getting hit. ..
       </font>
      </b>
      <font>
       <br />
       <b>
        <font>
         STICK TO THE SCHEDULE
         <br />
        </font>
       </b>
       <font>
        PB: JDs have a step-by-step migration guide. &quot;This is what you do when you go t beta, cut to prod, etc etc&quot;.
        <br />
        I think we probably should.
        <br />
        <br />
        AdV: My go to response is always &quot;look at the schedule!&quot;.&nbsp; The CA and JD all have their own domains.&nbsp; Drive it off the schedule
        <br />
        <br />
        PB: WIll develop a checklist to accompany the JD instruction lists.
        <br />
        <br />
        =========================
        <br />
        <br />
        Reloads are caused by
        <br />
        i) missing things in QA
        <br />
        ii) things reported, but were not fixed before prod loading started (process problem, or triage problem; PjM should be sure JD and CA are reviewing the other person items/&nbsp; Needs to be a final review meeting at the moment it's going to prod. )&nbsp; CA needs to review all feedback nad consult JD the point at which they go to start loading prod.
        <br />
        <br />
        PB: PxM should sit down with team IN ROOM to assign items at that point. Assign them well FROM THE START
        <br />
        <br />
        PxM should escalate items that aren't owned by team
        <br />
        <br />
        XPS: We should add to the QA template a column for &quot;prereq for prod content&quot;.&nbsp; The developer assigned to that task, or the CA.
        <br />
        <br />
        PB: Careful with timing... a JD
        <br />
        <br />
        AdV: I call JD and CA together, to review any unowned items. Whole team needs to participate.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the PjM who has to own it, even if it's assigned to someone.
        <br />
        <br />
        PB: summary
        <br />
        - after qa review, items are assigned together
        <br />
        - AdV point re: getting unloved items assigned by live meeting
        <br />
        - having content prereq column.
        <br />
        <br />
        iii) content work done, display worked lagged,&nbsp; So prod pushes ahead... and then you need to reprocess.
        <br />
        <br />
        BW: for sage/oup migrations we averaged over 1000 issues a day.
        <br />
        <br />
        CUSTOMER EXPECTATION
        <br />
        <br />
        AdV: part of problem containing publisher expectation is the PbMs are abdicating responsibility.
        <br />
        <br />
        ===
        <br />
        <br />
        * ATS, GSW require careful definition to customer management.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <font>
         * H2O content looking different from H1O, b/c of special processing we
         <br />
         did in H1O
         <br />
         <br />
         * publishers who never looked at their content previously now focus on
         <br />
         the details during migration
         <br />
         * HW's clear inclination to try to accommodate publishers when the
         <br />
         publisher gets cranky. Unwillingness to put the hammer down (perhaps
         <br />
         appropriately)
         <br />
         * publishers
         <font>
          <b>
           <font>
            not keeping on schedule
           </font>
          </b>
          <font>
           <br />
           * some very green PjMs
           <br />
           * significant things slipping through QA
           <br />
           <br />
           * unplanned staff transitions (PbM; but also PjM) that left customers sour and eroded our political capital.

   1. ASHA newsletters: to bundle or not to bundle?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; would it trouble (or anger) them if we bundle,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the sense that they may not trust us right
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now, and may wish to check our work as we go?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; do we please them by &quot;doing all the work&quot; by
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bundling?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; shall we ask ASHA their preference, or make the
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decision internally?
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: A draft schedule is now pending with Angie.
   <br />
   <br />
   <font>
    BW: Customer doesn't want to look at ANYTHING and he wants it to be perfect
    <br />
    Styling associated w/references, authors, section names, etc,
    <br />
    should be the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; We blew it on #17, it's different. We're going to try to do better tomorrow, for #18.
    <br />
    From there it will be easy to compare h10 to h20.&nbsp; Greg has checklist. Very close now.
    <br />
    Need to reschedule. They will want it 100% accurate, rather than by a deadline. BW says must be 2011.
    <br />
    <br />
    MK: If it's completely bundled, like the other bundles, rather than Paul B.
    <br />
    <br />
    XPS: few eras. Primarily NLM XML. not much content
    <br />
    <br />
    AdV: we can't cover ClinChem or CTSnet
    <br />
    <br />
    XPS: WE NEED SUPER QA, AND WE NEED TO DO ALL 16 SITES
    <br />
    AdV: will include more detail in the proto schedule.
    <br />
    BW: Get the checklist form Greg B on 18...
    <br />
    MK: Alerts were trouble. ARE MOVING alert checks into Alpha phase.
    <br />

     2. CTSNet: to migrate or not to migrate?
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; Directors appear to have decided to go ahead
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the migration in the absence of a firm
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; commitment
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; PbM (Polly) has strong reservations
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; has no official PjM at this time, but Angie is
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trying to keep moving it forward
     <br />
     <font>
      <br />
      CTSnet going to Dom b/c of OUP connection
      <br />
      BW: agree, we can't lay out a good schedule - umbrella, features. We'll need to get decisions on this pretty quickly.
      <br />
      Could be nasty umbrella arrangement if CTSnet wants sharing
      <br />
      AdV: 2 j's in Elsevier XML.... ACC...
      <br />
      Asian Annals... Sage... if CTSnet crumbles, asian annals would just get sucked into sage probably...

   1. ASHA newsletters: to bundle or not to bundle?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; would it trouble (or anger) them if we bundle,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the sense that they may not trust us right
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now, and may wish to check our work as we go?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; do we please them by &quot;doing all the work&quot; by
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bundling?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; shall we ask ASHA their preference, or make the
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decision internally?
   <font>
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: A draft schedule is now pending with Angie.
    <br />
    <font>
     <br />
     BW: There was on a call with ASHA today. They don't
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; want to look at anything, ever; they want us to
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get everything 100% correct, and if we don't then
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we're doing it wrong.
     <br />
     <br />
     RL: Sounded like he expects it to look exactly the
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; same on H2O as it does on H1O.
     <br />
     <br />
     BW: It's not so much the fonts and styling, as much
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the individual bits of content that need to
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look the same, be positioned in the same way as
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as on H1O. The things that ASHA is most
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; concerned about are: author display, title
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; display, section names. Structure.
     <br />
     <br />
     XS: Is a content briefing required here?
     <br />
     <br />
     BW: ASHA gave us a list of things that we need to
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; correct in #18 (launch) before we go live
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tomorrow. If we can solve everything in #18 to
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASHA's satisfaction, we should be able to go
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forward with migration. If HWP sees anything not
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on ASHA's list, we need to call them out for ASHA.
     <br />
     <br />
     XS: Are 1-16 cookie-cutter?
     <br />
     <br />
     BW: Yes. #17 (live) and #18 (pending) are now higher
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; visibility, and ASHA doesn't like what they're
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seeing, so we're going back in to address
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problems on both sites.
     <br />
     <br />
     MK: We are talking about a bundled approach.
     <br />
     <br />
     MJ: This does make it easier for ASHA to pin a
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;failure&quot; on HWP.
     <br />
     <br />
     XS: Few eras, not much content.
     <br />
     <br />
     BW: Yes, bundled approach. ASHA wants it to be done
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100% accurately.
     <br />
     <br />
     MK: Can the when be in January?
     <br />
     <br />
     BW: No, it has to be in 2011.
     <br />
     <br />
     MK: Who will PjM this one? Perhaps Paul, will take it
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; offline.
     <br />
     <br />
     ACTION: MK will talk to Paul and others about PjM.
     <br />
     <br />
     XS: We need to be clear that internal QA needs to be
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SERIOUSLY EXTRA SUPER-DUPER (emphasis Xenia's).
     <br />
     <br />
     ALL: AGREED!
     <font>
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: AdeV will incorporate explicit QA piece in
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; draft bundled schedule, as well as a task to
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QA alerts.
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: AdeV will solicit ASHA list of feedback from
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greg.
      <font>
       <br />
       <br />
       MK: We are now going to force an alerts sign-off on
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; launches, as well.
       <br />

        ACTION: PB will follow up with Rama to make sure that
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QA is happening on alerts.
        <font>
         <br />
         <br />
         MK: Will PbM be the person to officially sign off on
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sites before we show them to ASHA?
         <br />
         <br />
         MJ: Yes. It will be a new PbM, not Greg.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just no decision about the umbrella and which

  equations didn't translate properly

  PLT: Transition was done incorrectly
  <br />
  problem was in recent issue.

   I am suggesting a new concept in order to track some bugs that I believe
   <br />
   cannot be unique to this publisher. Such bugs will be called Referenced
   <br />
   Bugs or RB for short. This concept has probably been initiated before
   <br />
   under a different name, but for now I will use the proposed name for
   <br />
   this project. Here' s the list I currently have:
   <br />
   <br />
   RB Greek:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greek letters in formulas were encoded as
   <br />
   images in H1O, then converted into unicode for H2O, but there is a need to
   <br />
   italicize them in some situations (such as formulas). This cannot be done
   <br />
   today.
   <br />
   <font>
    <br />
    RB Citation-Authors:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Author names must follow a certain format.
    <br />
    The one required by BiolBull cannot be done today.
    <br />
    <br />
    RB Citation-Editors:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Editors names must follow a certain
    <br />
    format. The one required by BiolBull cannot be done today.
    <font>
     <br />
     <br />
     RB Equation:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Math equations were encoded as images in
     <br />
     H1O, then converted somehow by the Parser. The result is garbage in
     <br />
     BiolBull.
     <br />
     <br />
     RB Tagging:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;title&gt;&nbsp; tags are converted into&lt;source&gt;
     <br />
     by the NLM conversion process. However, we lose some context such as:
     <br />
     Chapter Title, Book Title, PhD Dissertation Title, etc...
     <br />
     <br />
     RB Italics:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a sentence is italicized, any string
     <br />
     within the sentence, that would normally be italicized by default (such
     <br />
     as a genus name), should be displayed in plain style instead. We cannot do
     <br />
     that for now.

  * QA does testing of migration sites at alpha phase before publisher Beta,

  * content sample phase almost in parallel to publisher beta,
  <br />
  * pre-launch on Beta and finally on migration day.

  Each of these have defined objectives.

  <br />
  <br />
  <b>
   <font>
    QA depends on PjMs
   </font>
  </b>
  <font>
   to inform the readiness of sites for respective QA tasks. This requires PjMs coordinating with JDs to prepare site, CAs load applicable content and both JDs/CA do very basic testing to ensure the site is ready for start of QA. PjMs can ensure this and inform QA to start QA. I find this is not happening or not happening timely to adhere to schedules. [KEEP SCHEDULES UPDATED]
   <br />
   <br />
   After hearing on site readiness from PjMs, QA will do the testing and inform back the PjM (and the team) about finishing of their testing along with entries in Internal QA for all issues as New. Those issues need to be reviewed by JD and CA with the help of PjM and addressed as

      The Process:
      <br />
      <font>
       - We have identified, with PbM approval, 14 sites that are very basic and can be treated in a streamlined manner
 - These 14 sites are organized into 2 sets of bundled migrations, with essentially the same time frame - 7 will launch on 10/18, 7 will launch on 10/20
 - We do not need kickoff meetings for these migrations, but have already held an internal kickoff mtg for developers and content leads
 - We are initially creating beta sites (no alpha sites), and these beta sites will point to prod. We will load sample content directly into prod
 - We will internally Q/A the sample content loaded into prod and will NOT turn over the beta sites to the publisher early in the process
       <font>
        <font>
         - We will NOT require publisher feedback on the sample content or site setup
 - When the sample content is &quot;signed off&quot; by us, we will begin loading the remainder of the content into prod, starting after Labor Day
 - We will internally Q/A the site and content AGAIN, later in the process, when all of site work is done
 - After a second round of Q/A, we will plan to turn the beta sites over to the publisher, so that they can review the site, and work on their file manager pages. This turnover is scheduled for approximately 10/4 - about 2 weeks before migration day.
 - We will expect Publishers to look over their site in just a few days (2-3) and let us know if they have any outstanding questions. They will NOT be expected to Q/A their site, or provide feedback in a spreadsheet. As always, they can work on their FM pages until the day before migration.

   Tuesday, 18 October&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thursday, 20 October

   <br />
   (QuickStart, MPP, MA). My goal is to be able to provide you with a final
   <br />
   version of each that you can prepare for your customers before we really
   <br />
   start digging into the work.

       * Launch projects may require different generated dates than
       <br />
       &nbsp; those developed for Migrations. Does this mean that we need
       <br />
       &nbsp; two different QuickBase schedule templates? Right now we're
       <br />
       &nbsp; using one template for both types of projects.
       <br />
       <br />
       * In the absence of 100% PjM coverage of launch and migration
       <br />
       &nbsp; projects, Margo has asked whether we should consider a
       <br />
       &nbsp; limited coverage model would allow us to stretch our limited
       <br />
       &nbsp; pool of PjM resources? Here are some ideas that Margo, Xenia
       <br />
       &nbsp; and I tossed around when the three of us met yesterday:
       <br />
       <br />
       &nbsp; --&gt; PjMs begin projects: Margo and Xenia would need to
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure that their resources were meeting project
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deadlines so that the PbMs don't have to; PbMs would
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manage customer interactions; feedback would be a
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; big time sink for non-PjM resources.
       <br />
       <br />
       --OR--
       <br />
       <br />
       &nbsp; --&gt; PjMs join projects at Alpha review: more work would
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be required of PbMs up-front; Margo and Xenia would
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; still have schedule approval; PjM would handle
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feedback drudgery and customer interactions (as
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appropriate for the PbM and the customer).
       <br />
       <br />
       --AND/OR--
       <br />
       <br />
       &nbsp; --&gt; We try to leverage QAE to help manage feedback: maybe
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they troll for feedback items that have been marked
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;fixed,&quot; do a visual confirmation, and close? Not
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sure they have any time for this sort of thing.
       <br />
       <br />
       Questions:
       <br />
       - how many new QA resources (interns, other) are joining
       <br />
       &nbsp; us for the summer, and are they fully committed
       <br />
       - any updates on hiring of even more PjMs

  AdV response
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  14:15 amdevilliers: 1. COB Biology Open: I'm not sure I understand Margo's comments. We don't have a PjM for this one, do we? Is she saying that the launch should be less difficult because we've got their other sites on H2O already, perhaps?
  <br />
  14:16 bing13: Yeah,
  <br />
  14:16 bing13: she's saying &quot;at least we've done some H2o sites with COB already.&quot; That's all.
  <br />
  14:17 amdevilliers: 2. RSMP: I can see the wisdom in upping it to 40%. I'm not remembering what the new feature is that's being developed, though, which is troubling since this is my project. I'll take a look.
  <br />
  14:17 bing13: sorry, she didn't say
  <br />
  14:17 amdevilliers: 3. ASHAJNLS/ASHASIG: I'm happy to go with her lower estimate. I think we also speculated that some efficiencies could be gained if the same PjM tackled them together.
  <br />
  14:18 bing13: yes.
  <br />
  14:19 amdevilliers: 4. ASHS. Upping this to 20% makes good sense. (Rich's RCPsych is a 3 site + 1 umbrella project, and it's already at 20%.)
  <br />
  14:20 bing13: ok
  <br />
  14:21 amdevilliers: 5. GSW: Yes, moving from 45% to 50% sounds reasonable to me. Always better to cushion rather than hope for smooth sailing. When we spoke last about GSW, Margo indicated that she thought the launch should be handled in parallel by the migration team; has she changed her mind about that? Has she spoken with LindaT, do you know?
  <br />
  BH: no
  <br />
  <br />
  14:24 amdevilliers: 6. BIR: I'm happy to reset this one at 20% (3 sites + 1 umbrella) if Margo agrees; I don't recall why I thought this would be more challenging than a typical multi-site migration.
  <br />
  <br />
  14:25 amdevilliers: Oh, sorry: 7. CHEST meeting abstracts. Jean specifically requested a PjM, but if we don't got one, hearing that this shouldn't be too difficult to manage makes it less painful to try to push this one back.
  <br />
  14:25 bing13: yes. and Margo actually volunteered to speak with her.
  <br />
  14:25 bing13: Did I mention that I love Margo?

  MK COB m BIology Open - at least we've launche dosme cob recently.

  MK STKE 30% ok NOW, higher if we go Drupal rollout.
  <br />
  <br />
  JCO could be less
  <br />
  <br />
  RSMP&nbsp; - challenging. Could be&nbsp; 40%
  <br />
  * Suite, with differences
  <br />
  * Work going on in H10.&nbsp; New feature needed in H2O launch
  <br />
  <br />
  ASHAJNLS/ASHASIG together are less than 40%; maybe 35% (20% for the major titless, 15% for newsletters.)
  <br />
  <br />
  ASHS umbrella makes it 20% rather than 15%

  AB: I want angie. It's a H10 project. It's content heavy, not features.

  AdV gets content.

  <br />
  All of what we're talking about here are H10 launches with respect to books.
  <br />
  There is no H10&nbsp; feature development

  OUP is still building on their book platform.... it's not on a product level.

    AB: Linda A &quot;there's not a lot she can do&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sites are transitional.&nbsp; Migrating all these two H20 will be a enormous commitment. Mired in content cruft from the last two years.&nbsp; There are also features on the OUP Custom that are attractive our other platforms, and I'd like to productize those.&nbsp; Long term.... I'd like to build up expertise throughout organization that isn't just me

        <br />
        Otherwise let angie complete those that are open.
        <br />
        AdV would have to train TIen
        <br />

        AB: I would be running books until the handover.... AdV would have to mentor the migrations she owns..
        <br />
        <br />
        AB: In theory, LP owns the publication manager role for OUP, journals and books. But AB has done a lot of hte PbM role. (Not talk to Execs, contracts, travelto UK etc).&nbsp;&nbsp; PjM should do

      AdV: we gave them to Tien, b/c we were just figuring out what # of PjMs we had. WE never returned to specifics .&nbsp;&nbsp; I was pretty convinced by Anh on Friday morning.&nbsp; Agree re: training H10 books.
      <br />
      OTOH, any new person has to learn everything from scratch.&nbsp; Could bootstrap someone with appropriate support.&nbsp; Would be faster for me, w/content and H10.
      <br />
      There's plenty of people to ask questions of.
      <br />
      I don't care. If I work on migs then books, I'll document everything.
      <br />
      I'd do a lot of documentation if I do books.

      My vacation?
      <br />

       <br />
       DOM's RSMP will be the biggest hit for vacation - 20+ sites. NOn-standard (multiple beta, staging sites, separate review of umbrella)
       <br />
       Fairly well mapped out, schedule just coming up now.
       <br />
       ** BIG , but established design;&nbsp; And Dom and AdV both could help
       <br />
       The alpha sites are up and sample content loaded, just have to finalize schedule, and get doc's out.

         Protocols is custom, single site.

         Alpha starts in two weeks. June 27 internal alpha review.&nbsp;&nbsp; Site is there, AdV is doing initial QA with JD and Polly. IN 2 weeks, internal QA team comes in. Then,while we're doign that, Polly goes away.&nbsp; We'll have to judge readiness without her, do beta, deal with customer beta feedback.&nbsp; Challenge for anyone!

   AdV: requests from PjMs have been putting in requests very recently.

   ==========================================

   1. stoplight and related
   <br />
   a. the short-term request
   <br />
   b. the larger need to coordinate; assess resource availability; do scheduling
   <br />
   c. the EVEN larger need for PROCESS,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - makes more efficient use of people's time
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mark c: &quot;we've got to stop w/the emails on this kind of stuff and have the PbMs? make an entry in QB, complete w/the explanation of what and when... Can we have the PbM do that for this? &quot;

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; liz tb: &quot; very much appreciate project management support for the Full Migration project we need to complete for JCO this year.
   <font>
    Xenia has the details of the project
    <font>
     , but in summary - we need to convert all of JCO's back content to NLM XML and the load these files to the site.
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - allows intelligent analysis to be done, rather than &quot;swarming&quot;
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not saying &quot;I don't want to deal with it!&quot; and running away - on either side.

           <br />
           my signature. Critical items for today's discussion are, in my estimation:
           <br />
           <br />
           * biolbull won't renew contract/LOA until we've confirmed migration
           <br />
           &nbsp; date; LindaT needs this info by the end of the week; currently
           <br />
           &nbsp; scheduled for 31 August, but no PjM has been assigned; not clear
           <br />
           &nbsp; whether Linda is available to participate as PbM
           <br />
           <br />
           * new GSW launch not yet in Next_100; anybody have info on that so
           <br />
           &nbsp; that we can add it to the list for resource planning?
           <br />
           <br />
           * &quot;too many&quot; launches and migrations scheduled for September; M/A/X
           <br />
           &nbsp; needs help prioritizing so that some can be shifted out
           <br />
           <br />
           * review of projects with &quot;questionable&quot; status (item #8)
           <br />
           <br />
           * discussion of the PbM role in a launch/migration project when a PjM
           <br />
           &nbsp; resource has been assigned
           <br />
           <br />
           Additions and revisions are welcome.
           <br />
           <br />
           Speak to you all whenever we eventually meet!

           &nbsp;&nbsp; - how will we train new PjMs
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- need to reduce need for PbMs to guide new PjMs
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through the migration (and possibly launch) process
           <br />

           &nbsp;&nbsp; - what's the &quot;new normal&quot; for migration management
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Are certain PbMs still expected to manage one or
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more of their migrations (i.e. Greg, Christine,
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cathy, others)?
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- For those migrations that require PjM support, are
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PbMs prepared to participate as appropriate?

  <br />
  <br />
  + Put PLC (product life cycle) process in place
  <br />
  + products, customer requests in pipeline
  <br />
  + multiple bug trackers - crazy!&nbsp; We're using Jira! Done! It will be part of our general tool set. Greenhopper.&nbsp;&nbsp; Will tie into QB - formal interface. Could get us a consultant in, to help us design our Jira workflow.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's that integral.
  <br />
  <br />
  RL: My engineers want to look at *all* of their tasks through Jira.
  <br />
  MC: great! Jira's great for that.
  <br />
  <br />
  * more transparency, including schedules!
  <br />
  * I'm BIG on hitting schedule targets. We'll blow some - &quot;This is really new for these guys&quot;
  <br />
  <br />
  MC: you assign tasks to developers...&nbsp; I don't want priorities changed day-to-day.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  MC: I will rely on Mark J to prioritize all customer requests
  <br />
  <br />
  MC: Tom made the point this morning, that everything as &quot;urgent&quot;, is nothing is not prioritizing.
  <br />
  <br />
  MC: I asked Polly to tweak QB ... If MC and RL aren't goign to use it as their main tools, maybe we don't want to ask her to do huge amount of work.
  <br />
  Asked for a few
  <b>
   <font>
    Project life Cycle fields: Investigation, Design, Coding, Testing, Released to Production target dates.
   </font>
  </b>
  <font>
   &nbsp; Mitigations, respect for target dates... Agile burndown and remaining work charts should be had on a daily basis.
   <br />
   <br />
   MC: Am cautious about engineers inflating their estimates.&nbsp; I'm going to grade my engineers on hitting schedule, and quality targets.&nbsp;&nbsp; I ike engineers to come up with dates
   <b>
    <font>
     themselves, so they own it
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    .
    <br />
    <br />
    MC: sometime requirements change.&nbsp; We've gotta have a process to handle change requests. That's a date change, not a slip.
    <br />
    <br />
    MC: I want us to get to more and more and more Agile development methodology.
    <br />
    <br />
    MC: I require cross-team design reviews.&nbsp; I want to see the minutes from the code review before I sign off.
    <br />
    <br />
    MC: We seem to be heading towards QB as an external-facing tool.&nbsp; Jira faces inward.
    <br />
    <br />
    MC:&nbsp; I would like to move towards Releases. But that's beyond me.&nbsp; I told time I suggest a quarterly system code releaes, and monthly app's release.
    <br />
    This ties to the roadmap. TOm wants 18-24 month roadmap
    <br />
    <br />
    MC: our production environment is unstable. If we fix the operations problems, we'll still have engineering-habit generated problems.
    <br />
    <br />
    POR (product * roadmap)
    <br />
    ==================
    <br />
    RAMA
    <br />
    <br />
    * 3 summer interns
    <br />
    Rachel, Greg, Rachel, TOdd, Mark - talked on what they can work on
    <br />
    - automation
    <br />
    (1)... XSL widget (core logic)
    <br />
    (2) middleware/backend SASS,&nbsp; all APP. We can use that to validate APIs.&nbsp; [HWX, ]
    <br />
    (3) HWX - test journal. variety of sample content, cover idiosyracies of our content.&nbsp; Daily basis. Run through that sample content thru HWX.
    <br />
    Not 100% sure if 3rd intern should go on this. HWX team believes they have solid testing. they don't have time to work with us.

  w/r/t process &quot;review&quot;, we keep banging against it piecemeal. Would it be useful to take time at these meetings to

  2) outline what we think we need.

  AdV: Protocols - Polly can't move it forward. Very custom on H10. Odd content.

  Some work in last year to make it a bit more customized. Polly *still* hasnt completed NExt 100. We still don't know&nbsp; which H1O features need porting.

    <font>
     <br />
     + TAKE IT TO WARP if there is any possibility of escalation, productizing, comfusion, etc

  Welcome to Lydia, Rich
  <br />
  <br />
  - Lydia: we have to manage the customer, AND the PbM
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * PjM training possibilities / opportunities
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Steps/Process after WARP process&nbsp; --Xenia
  <br />
  Out of warp, we get WHO and HOW, and the steps
  <br />
  XPS: that's at a high level. Where does the tech spec come from?&nbsp; Warp meeting names names, but it doesn't mean those people are going to be available.
  <br />
  LB: project charter.... signoff, etc etc.
  <br />
  RL: priority, resources, in constricted environment. (Old HW: schedule, prioritize, fail)
  <br />
  RL: (Kanban queue)
  <br />
  Should also apply for complex projects as well
  <br />
  &quot;I'm not afraid to take baby steps.&quot;
  <br />
  RL:
  <font>
   You need prioritization before you do the technical spec
   <font>
    <br />
    <font>
     RL:
     <font>
      So it needs to go back to PbM, who prioritizes within the list of the customer's priorities
      <font>
       <br />
       RL: WARP identifies *who* could write the tech spec.
       <br />
       XPS: How do we identify the resources?
       <br />
       BH: Boil the ocean!

    schwab had 1,000 developers.

    XPS: site-support does casual review well. But can't handle PRD-sized stuff.
    <br />
    Site-support doesn't have representatives from all invovled gorups

    Another is AC; content; data warehouse,
    <br />
    <br />
    Customer request meeting: WARP - weekly analysis review and projects would meet weekly, and go through the requests.
    <br />
    Schwab did this for 1000 programmers, with a meeting of 25 Tech department heads. The result was feasibility; ballpark difficult;
    <br />
    A written functional spec was required for a PjM to hand a project to this &quot;tech star&quot; review
    <br />
    <br />
    Whoever wrote the PRD should be in the room.
    <br />
    <br />
    WARP input is PRD [customer requests; product feature enhancement; platform innovation]
    <br />
    <br />
    WARP output is feasibility, approach, ID steps, ID people/groups, and if requested ballpark of effort and timing
    <br />
    <br />
    BH: whatever you bring to WARP should have an ID.

    RL:&nbsp; the meeting should have a recorder; the record should also get the results of the discussion at WARP.
    <br />

    RL: Mike said we need to use QB. Jira will be used for bug tracking system.
    <br />
    We have bought site license for Jira.

    <br />

    XPS: at Atypon there was a QB and a Jira,, and all records were reflected in both systems.&nbsp; Developers only looked at BZugzilla (Jira)

   Rama - adjustments to schedule?
   <br />
   alpha test is ok - limited to content
   <br />
   prelaunch QA, I want to do more than what is happening.
   <br />
   Want to verify all the issues, content and site.
   <br />
   And not proceed until content complete (?)
   <br />
   More often 2-3 days prior to launch. �2 part time people. Hard to juggle.

   * older erase qa'd in content site soon after beta site is released

     <br />
     XPS
     <br />
     <br />
     Below are my notes from the meeting - let me know if there are any important omissions.
     <br />
     <br />
     (1) Rama's current QA process during a migration involves the following points:
     <br />
     (a) QA of alpha site (focus on sample issues &amp; site).
     <br />
     (b) QA when alpha is renamed to beta.
     <br />
     (c) QA when beta points to prod (focus on OM or FM content &amp; site)
     <br />
     (d) QA when new site launches/migrates.
     <br />
     <br />
     (2) Team suggests that point (b) above is not a high-risk change necessitating QA. Content and
     <br />
     code is not copied or modified. Margo will get back to the team with specific detail on what happens
     <br />
     during this step (is the beta site copied or regenerated?). Regardless, it's been suggested that the
     <br />
     QA team skips this step. The PbM should be responsible to QA the publisher's account access on
     <br />
     the beta site -- this is the only thing that has proved to be error prone in the past.
     <br />
     Dave will set up a machine that the PbMs will use to validate that sites work with pub access.
     <br />
     <br />
     (3) Musikaar doesn't have access to the beta site or to the content site. They do their automated QA
     <br />
     on the beta site only (when it is pointed to prod).
     <font>
      Rama to work with MarkH to advise on where the content
      <br />
      sites need to live so that Musikaar can have access.
      <font>
       <br />
       <br />
       (4) For OM, we'll have the following QA steps:
       <br />
       (a) Sample issues from recent era are QAed in alpha.
       <br />
       (b) When beta points to prod (~2 weeks before launch) QA team tests all content, including OM.
       <br />
       No content QA happens on the content site.
       <br />
       (c) QA when new site launches/migrates.
       <br />
       <br />
       (5) For FM, we'll have the following QA steps:
       <br />
       (a) Sample issues from recent era are QAed in alpha.
       <br />
       (b) Sample issues from older eras are QAed on content site (timing of this will vary, but generally it will
       <br />
       happen around the same time when the publisher is doing their beta QA)
       <br />
       (c) When beta points to prod (~2 weeks before launch) QA team tests all content.
       <br />
       (d) QA when new site launches/migrates.
       <br />
       <br />
       (6) Musikaar runs their
       <font>
        automated scripts
        <font>
         on samples and full content as well. Musikaar also invests time
         <br />
         after each QA cycle to clean up the scripts based on what was found and marked as 'will not fix'.
         <br />
         <br />
         (7) Currently, the QA team is not performing any validation QA on fixes, but hopefully this will be introduced�when we start using Jira. The current plan is to use Jira for externally reported bugs.
         <br />
         <br />
         (8) browser testing - Dave will provide the QA team with 2 desktop machines to do side by side QA on 2�different browsers.
         <br />
         <br />
         (9) Next week is DDT but Ron will reschedule the meeting earlier in the week (Mon afternoon?) &amp; we'll review�Rama's visual design demonstrating the OM and FM QA process. At that time, we can determine if Rama can�present this at the PbM meeting on Tues. The goal of that presentation is to inform the PbMs of the QA processes�and also give them information that they can tell customers.

    Agile is better for new projects, where things aren't well defined up front. If everything is totally defined ahead of time, waterfall might be the way to go.

  RL: you can use scrum task boards (&quot;information radiator&quot; when it's tactile)
  <br />
  Sprints focus on new functionality, but other methods that are part of Scrum - like task boards are universally applicable.
  <br />
  <br />
  scrum (a management methodology) is often paired with XP (programming techniques)
  <br />
  <br />
  RL: The sprint where you can't change the spec, followed by the totally open end of sprint review, is the Ying and Yang of scrum. It's totally flexible, and it's just right.

    The Gracenote parking structure is open during the week to visitors.&nbsp; When you arrive, please come up to the receptionist on the 15th floor, and she�ll let us know you�ve arrived.&nbsp; Ultimately, we�ll end up on the 13th floor in one of our brand new conference rooms (�Twin Peaks�), but you will all need to check in at reception on 15 as guests before we can bring you down.

    Between myself and Saood, we likely have almost 3 hours of material / process / tools / tips / etc to share.&nbsp; If you have anything in particular that you want to see covered, please let us know.&nbsp; For now, we expect to cover items such as:

      </font>
     </font>
    </i>
    <font>
     <br />
     <br />
     I was hired into a 15-year-old organization of 150 that's still mostly operating as though it's an organization of 5 or 10; we're changing out our architecture, much as Gracenote has done twice. But unlike how I've heard Mickey describe it, we're trying to deliver features to our 150 publishers (and 1300+ scholarly journals) simultaneous with changing the platform. Not surprisingly, the platform change is taking four years, not two; the organization is dramatically congested; projects get attention only if they're in absolute flames; and the organization is wildly inefficient at dealing with all that.
     <br />
     <br />
     Improving our processes even just slightly would be ever-so-welcome. To give you an idea, HighWire has not even had a shared calendar system (we're about halfway through viral adoption now, I'm happy to say), we have perhaps a half dozen bug tracking systems, and nothing in the way of project management tools.
     <font>
      We do have three solid project managers (despite only one having had any real training in project management) along with a development manager who is exceptional partly because of a personal interest in doing project management well. We also have some of the nicest people I've ever worked with.

  <br />
  Eliciting Requirements: Questions for PbMs:
  <br />
  What are you trying to accomplish? What is the problem you're trying to solve?
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <font>
   neither the publisher nor the PbM should be specifying a techn solution
   <font>
    <br />
    Do you understand what it is they're trying to accomplish? what cust expects to see?
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exactly what and where will they see on the site?
    <br />
    Sample URL
    <br />
    How does this apply to back content?
    <br />
    Peripheral systems that should be thought about:
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does this affect alerts?
    <br />
    What would the customer be willing to pay for for this?
    <br />
    Does it have to be a quick thing for them to want to do this?
    <br />
    Did you specify the journalcode(s)?&nbsp; Is this h10 or h20?
    <br />
    Have you translated publisher terminology into the correct Highwire terminology?
    <br />
    <font>
     ...
     <br />
     Did you re-read your request before sending?

  G is careful to bound the scope of work that forms the halo around the core deals that are cut by our sales agents.
  <br />
  <br />
  G had been trying to adopt Salesforce.com for a year and a half.
  <br />
  <br />
  The functions G wanted to implement were boiled down to:
  <br />
  * status report on projects
  <br />
  * milestones
  <br />
  * issue tracking
  <br />
  * hours
  <br />
  <br />
  Salesforce (SF) originally did simply:&nbsp; accounts &lt;-&gt; opportunities &lt;-&gt; contacts
  <br />
  provides security, scalability, forecasting (on opportunities, which have probabilities)
  <br />
  SF also has &quot;custom tables&quot;, which let us build in our project management&nbsp; stuff.

    <br />
    <font>
     [we want to add up to at least 40&nbsp;&nbsp; hours, so that's a pretty complete accounting]
     <br />
     S: We tell our PSA engineers, they're better and more important than &quot;grunty&quot; engineers, and we expect more than from them, ex., accounting for the customer's sake, etc..
     <br />
     S: If we dont have visible, metrics, payoff calculations, we're not going anywhere.

      Waterfall and Agile do the same phases, but Agile does them shorter and more frequently
      <br />
      G is trying to do a hybridized approach, where the req, high level description and Release&nbsp; plan. happen up front, and then sprint the implementation.
      <br />
      <br />
      Shawn says G is not mature about Proj Planning at the moment teyr'e experimenting with
      <b>
       <font>
        the pressures of needing to keep release schedules, and engineers who want everything to be Agile

      <font>
       .
       <br />
       <br />
       Important to have everyone share project definition, process management, etc across the organization, and agree on the steps,&nbsp; criteria, etc

         <font>
          We use MS Project Server to manager resoruces. So if someone is working on 3 projects, it will be

           with other PjMs to divvy up them up.
           <br />
           The resource map TOOL provides visibility and we can work on that
           <br />
           Agile people don't want to plan beyond 4 weeks, which doesn't work well with this!
           <font>
            <br />
            We use JIRA to manage the Agile resources.
            <br />

            Does HW have a product roadmap

            <br />
            <font>
             <br />
             When Shawn got to Gracenote 5 or so years ago, it was very HW like with prioritization&nbsp; and resource management. Executives wouldn't give meaning prioritization, everything was #1. Sounds very familiar.
             <font>
              <br />
              I had
              <b>

              <font>
               here for a YEAR before management would
               <br />
               <br />
               &quot;IT's a process of educating the executives&quot;
               <br />
               It was very hard to get people to report their time. It was a persuasion effort.
               <br />
               We actually have them report their hours through the PWA (project web access) web inteface (to the resource map)
               <br />
               <br />
               Some of their managers use MS Project 10%/50%/100% done feature. Shawn much prefers that people enter their actual hours each week, b/c it helps us learn and improve estimates.
               <br />
               <br />
               We keep telling them &quot;We don't use the resource reporting for anything excpet proj management!&quot;
               <br />
               <br />
               SM has some great consultants for bringing in this kind of system.
               <br />
               SM does prefer MS Project Server.&nbsp; For pure resource management,
               <b>
                <font>
                 it's awesome.

                <br />
                <br />
                We had high level execs on the PAC, but over time, we decided we don't need them. Exec's set up product road map (6 month and 2 years).
                <br />
                <br />
                SM: Our code base is &quot;bandaid and duct tap&quot;. We've declared a feature timeout, so we can get back an maintain the base.
                <br />
                <br />
                SM: CFO and CEO will be on our &quot;advisory&quot; committee, if we need them (if PAC can't self-govern)
                <br />
                <br />
                Jira/Greenhopper is used for managing Agile projects.

  January 2011 update
  <br />
  <br />
  The release user comments indicate there are some meaningful bugs (ex., w/permissions)
  <br />

  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  dotProject is built using
  <b>
   <font>
    free
   </font>
  </b>
  <font>
   open-source applications and is produced and maintained by a small, but dedicated group of volunteers.
   <br />
   dotProject is programmed in PHP, and utilises MySQL for a backend database (although other databases such as Postgres could also be used).
   <br />
   <br />
   Our recommended server platform includes Apache 1.3.27, PHP 4.2+, and
   <b>
    <font>
     MySQL
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    .
    <br />
    <br />
    In the spirit of free, peer-reviewed, open source application development, we would also encourage you to use an operating system such as
    <b>
     <font>
      Linux
     </font>
    </b>
    <font>
     , FreeBSD, or OpenBSD. However, additional operating systems such as Windows, Mac, and other flavours of *nix are also supported.

   I am going to create a 3 week trial account for you on Project.net.&nbsp; If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
   <br />
   <br />
   Please go to login.project.net and select the registratoin link at the right of the page.&nbsp; When prompted to enter a license key, please enter:
   <br />
   2-9ASNW-3EFA3-APUK2-7TYP4
   <br />
   <br />
   There is context sensitive help in the application on the upper right of each screen. Here are some helpful links:
   <br />
   1) Beta FAQ:
   <a href="http://faq-beta.project.net/">
    http://faq-beta.project.net/
   </a>
   <br />
   2) Link to version 9.0 documentation (currently being updated):
   <a href="http://doc.project.net">
    http://doc.project.net
   </a>
   <br />
   <br />
   Warm Regards,
   <br />
   Tim
   <br />
   <br />
   PS Adding people to the trial:
   <br />
   You can add people with the license key above. The best process is to add all users to a single high level business. To do this:
   <br />
   1) Select/create a business
   <br />
   2) Select the directory menu item (top of page)
   <br />
   3) Select 'Invite Member&quot; in the left hand menu
   <br />
   4) Enter first name, last name, email at the top right of the page
   <br />
   5) Select the down arrow next to the user email (repeat if needed)
   <br />
   6) Select &quot;Add New Invitees&quot; at the bottom of the page
   <br />
   7) Select �administrator� for rights
   <br />
   8) Select �invite� at the bottom right of the page
   <br />
   <br />
   Adding people to a project is similar.
   <br />
   1) Complete through step 3 (above) for a project (rather than a business)
   <br />
   2) On the left of the page, search on the high level business that you added (above)
   <br />
   3) At this point you can select users using a checkbox option.

     Thank you for your recent inquiry about Project.net.&nbsp; Here are the answers to some of your questions:
     <br />
     1) The cost is $250/named user/year.&nbsp; This is a support fee (we do not charge for licenses - 20% educational discount can be taken off price.
     <br />
     2) Unlimited workflows are allowed
     <br />
     3) We do have integrated bug tracking through our custom tracking databases (forms).&nbsp; We do not integrate with subversion.
     <br />
     4) We can do cross project reporting.&nbsp; Detailed reporting of this fashion would likely use our Pentaho integration
     <br />
     5) You are able to archive projects without deleting the data
     <br />
     6) There are public APIs we are working to expand what currently exists
     <br />
     7) Customers could submit tickets throught the system but not follow them
     <br />
     <br />
     <br />
     Could you confirm the expected number of users, budget constraints, expected deployment date, and the major issues you hope to address?
     <br />
     <br />
     I look forward to helping make your initiative a success. Please let me know the next steps you would like to take.
     <br />
     <br />
     Best Regards,
     <br />
     Tim
     <br />
     <br />
     PS&nbsp; If you are not looking for support, the open source distribution is available on sourceforge.net.
     <br />

  I represent a software development unit of Stanford University. We're interested in learning more about your product, educational pricing, and perhaps trial access. We have approximately 150 employees, and are interested in project management, resource management, bug and feature tracking, and related matters.&nbsp; We are not an Oracle shop (we do Sybase), and so may be interested in a hosted solution. (Oracle Express looks interesting, but I can't tell if the data limits are low, given how project.net uses it.)
  <br />
  Among our initial questions:
  <br />
  <br />
  What is the licensing model: per user, �concurrent user� model, etc.
  <br />
  How many workflows can be created?
  <br />
  Can you integrate the bug tracking system with Subversion (which we use for code control)?
  <br />
  Can you do cross-project reporting?
  <br />
  Can you archive projects without physically deleting the data?
  <br />
  Are there public API�s? (I believe the answer is &quot;yes&quot;)
  <br />
  Could we offer a Customer &quot;portal&quot; (i.e., so customers could submit and view their tickets, but not other data)
  <br />
  <br />
  I will be away from the office Monday and Tuesday, but will try to check e-mail. Many thanks for your assistance.

  You explicitly state that Easy Projects .NET is an software project management tool. What makes this product especially suited for SOFTWARE project management?
  <br />
  There are plenty of &quot;fits all sizes&quot; project applications with millions of features. In contrast Easy Projects has only those tools and features that you need to manage your software project. Not engineering, not construction, just software. No bells and whistles � usual software project managers just don't have time to spend on learning sophisticated products.
  <br />
  Easy Projects .NET was initially developed as an internal software project management tool and has gradually evolved into a commercial product. Before introducing any new feature or module to the public, Logic Software first deploys this piece of code within our own company and works with it for a while to make sure that it's easy to use.

  &quot;Create a project plan using the powerful 2-plan Desktop application and then upload the work packages on the schedule for your team to access using the 2-plan Team web application.
  <br />
  Your team will break down the work package into a detailed list of tasks where they will assign estimates, team resources, and provide you status updates by tracking their time all within the web application.
  <br />
  While your team is working on tasks, you can update your plan with the latest status and real forecast information.&quot;

                                    Choosing a web-based project management tool best-suited to your organization�s needs can often be a daunting task. A tool that works perfectly for Project A may be overkill for Project B and there�s no one size fits all rule that works just as well for all projects. Unless you are an enterprise user, VersionOne would probably be an overkill. If you are looking for a self-hosting version, LiquidPlanner, PivotalTracker and LiquidPlanner are non-starters. Further, apart from 2Plan Team, each of the other tools reviewed has significant budgetary implications as well. If you are looking for an open-source web-based project management tool with powerful third-party integration capabilities, we recommend that you explore 2Plan Team. Coming at the best possible price � FREE, it�s surely worth a try.

   HighWire still has not made a decision which tools should be used for project/issue management. This is a long time overdue and I would like to expedite the evaluation process to get it done. I hope we can work together as a team to make it happened.

   <br />
   Questions:
   <br />
   What is the licensing model: per user or �concurrent user� model?
   <br />
   How many workflows can be created?
   <br />
   Can you integrate bug tracking system with Subversion?

   Can you do cross-project reporting?
   <br />
   Can you archive projects without physically deleting the data?

  <br />
  AL
  <br />
  <br />
  I completed some preliminary testing of the Replicon systems today
  <br />
  with mixed results. I'll say the testing has lead to much frustration,
  <br />
  although I'll acknowledge that I haven't spent much (ok, any) time
  <br />
  ready the manuals. (I hate manuals.)
  <br />
  <br />
  I started with WebResource, creating a project
  <br />
  (Migration_TestLoadToTimeSheet), creating some tasks, assigning them,
  <br />
  etc. I subsequently sent that project to TimeSheet and tried to
  <br />
  interact with that project there. I found the later operation
  <br />
  confusing and ultimately confounding, although I didn't spend much
  <br />
  time trying to troubleshoot it. I'll return to that, but in the
  <br />
  meantime I thought I'd report on my WebResource experience...
  <br />
  <br />
  I think the greatest benefit of the experience was that it helped me
  <br />
  define
  <b>
   <i>
    <font>
     <font>
      my mental model
     </font>
    </font>
   </i>
  </b>
  <font>
   of how I think the system should work. I would
   <br />
   expect:
   <br />
   <br />
   * I set up a project (potentially based on a template) that includes
   <br />
   phases, tasks, and effort estimates (measured in hours) for those
   <br />
   tasks
   <br />
   * I set a project start date. The system schedules all follow on tasks
   <br />
   and deliverables accordingly assuming 100% allocation of resources.
   <br />
   * I assign staff to the project and set an allocation.
   <br />
   * I assign staff to particular tasks.
   <br />
   * Given those assignments, project allocations, and effort estimates
   <br />
   the system returns a modified schedule
   <br />
   * Modifications could be iterative, ie a PjM could setup a project
   <br />
   based on a template. I could enter my assignments and allocations. The
   <br />
   schedule would self-adjust. Subsequently Margo could enter her
   <br />
   assignments and allocations. The system would adjust again. These
   <br />
   adjustments would take into consideration task dependencies as well.
   <font>
    <br />
    <br />
    I'd be curious to hear other's reactions to this model.
    <br />
    <br />
    Replicon WebResource does not work according to my model.
    <br />
    <br />
    An area of particular frustration to me was the reporting/resolution
    <br />
    of conflicts between task duration and allocation. I
    <br />
    <br />
    * defined task with duration of 5 working days; this assignment is to
    <br />
    5 specific days, not to any 5 days (or 40 hours)
    <br />
    * assigned a resource to that task with an allocation of 40%. (note
    <br />
    that allocation is by task rather than project, which seems
    <br />
    counterintuitive to me)
    <br />
    * clicked &quot;Calculate Duration&quot; and it extended the task duration
    <br />
    beyond the scheduled duration and issues an &quot;!&quot; followed by a warning
    <br />
    at the top of the page which noted the duration now extends beyond the
    <br />
    scheduled time frame but that extension didn't seem to &quot;cascade&quot; to
    <br />
    subsequent tasks/dependencies
    <br />
    * I returned to the project calendar and the duration of that task had
    <br />
    stretched to accurately reflect the assigned allocation, but there was
    <br />
    no (visual) indication that this wasn't per original (template)
    <br />
    schedule (other than the fact that the task now overlaps with others,
    <br />
    although this wouldn't necessarily signal a problem)
    <br />
    * The project calender accurately reflects overlapping tasks but
    <br />
    doesn't visually indicate that that might be a problem.
    <br />
    <br />
    I know that's a lot to digest. I hope my bullet-point account
    <br />
    <br />
    Also, almost any operation requires one to scroll to the bottom of the
    <br />
    page and click &quot;Save&quot;. This makes is easy to lose work, I think. (And
    <br />
    this gets to Bernie's earlier point that this isn't AJAX.) It's
    <br />
    annoying to assign tasks, see what you want on the screen, and to have
    <br />
    to remember to explicitly save it. I lost several tasks and
    <br />
    assignments because I forgot to do that.
    <br />
    <br />
    OK, time for some soup...
    <br />

  Hi Bernard,
  <br />
  �� I noticed that you have just user access.
  <br />
  Now I have given jira-admin and jira-developer access as well.
  <br />
  <br />
  In the DemoTrialDummy project, you can create and do anything. You have full access to it.
  <br />
  There seems to be limited security flexibility to provide a user with just read access. At least I do not know about it.
  <br />
  <br />
  Now I have enabled accept remote API calls. It is turned off by default.

    Jira has a command line interface (CLI), written in Python. It uses the API which is&nbsp; SOAP.
    <br />
    Looks like the easiest way to get commands into and out of Jira.

  1. The REST API is easy, but incomplete. Seems to only have services that pertain to issues. Can't see how to get a *list* of issues, which is sad, b/c It's all I need.

  2. The full-bore API consists of a *ton* of Java packages.

                   <br />
                   &quot;Jneuro has some upcoming articles that contain audio snippets. On the display, they want to have a figure call out that the user can click on to hear the audio. Our system needs to use a media player that supports various audio formats.

                     * 1 PjM for migrations (after Phac and Tien);

                     <br />
                     * and then Product Management wants to do some things (.5 PjM);
                     <br />
                     * AND we need 2 XSL people,
                     <br />
                     * AND short in site support by 1.5 devs;
                     <br />
                     * AND migration dev by 1
                     <br />
                     * &amp;&nbsp; Sage by .5 dev
                     <br />
                     And MK lost a developer 100% to PNAS.

    I'll insert the comments that I shared with you via IM below, so that they

    Thanks for getting Margo to sanity check these numbers.

    Margo's comments. Overall, she rubber stamped almost all of our ratings.
    <br />
    Where she suggested adjustments, the were on the order of 5%.&nbsp; Her
    <br />
    concerns about GSW are no surprise.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    * COB m BIology Open - at least we've work for COB recently.&nbsp; Launched
    <br />
    JOCES and JEXBIO in April. Difficult, but we did.
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;AdeV: I'm not sure I understand Margo's comments. We don't have a PjM
    <br />
    for this one, do we? Is she saying that the launch should be less
    <br />
    difficult because we've got their other sites on H2O already, perhaps?
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;BH: Yeah, she's saying &quot;at least we've done some H2o sites with COB
    <br />
    already.&quot; That's all.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    * STKE 30% ok NOW, higher if we go Drupal rollout.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    * JCO could be less
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    * RSMP&nbsp; - challenging. Could be&nbsp; 40%.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suite, with differences between
    <br />
    sites. Also, work ongoing in H10.&nbsp; New feature being developed ofr H2O
    <br />
    launch
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;AdeV: I can see the wisdom in upping it to 40%. I'm not remembering
    <br />
    what the new feature is that's being developed, though, which is troubling
    <br />
    since this is my project. I'll take a look.
    <br />
    <br />
    UPDATE: I think this may be the installation of xPDF at the time of
    <br />
    migration ... I'm not seeing an actual &quot;launch&quot; project in the works for
    <br />
    this customer, anyway. I'll touch base with Margo tomorrow to make sure I
    <br />
    understand what this &quot;new feature&quot; really is.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    * ASHAJNLS/ASHASIG together are less than 40%; maybe 35% (20% for the
    <br />
    major titless, 15% for newsletters.)
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;AdeV: I'm happy to go with her lower estimate. I think we also
    <br />
    speculated that some efficiencies could be gained if the same PjM tackled
    <br />
    them together.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    * ASHS - the umbrella makes it 20% rather than 15%
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;AdeV: Upping this to 20% makes good sense. (Rich's RCPsych is a 3 site
    <br />
    + 1 umbrella project, and it's already at 20%.)
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    * GSW - Caution! trouble.&nbsp; GSW pre-requirements (with Rich) should be
    <br />
    ultra-high priorities. MK doesn't expect problems. Maybe yucky old
    <br />
    content, though.
    <br />
    GSW mig has to be coordinated with migration of parent sites that have
    <br />
    to happen ahead of time. So paleos, sepm, canmin, econgeo, ssabull,
    <br />
    jsedres&nbsp; need to migrate before end of september.
    <br />
    Has to be coordinated with content transition work that hasn't happened yet
    <br />
    Mirror site needs to be implemented for the first time in H20.
    <br />
    Some custom work.s
    <br />
    So MK suggests 50%.
    <br />
    New GSW launching site with date of November, which will slip. Unless we
    <br />
    have cycles to deal with this new Italian rocks journal.
    <br />
    GSW portal is not being done at the same time. Separate project.
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;AdeV: Yes, moving from 45% to 50% sounds reasonable to me. Always
    <br />
    better to cushion rather than hope for smooth sailing. When we spoke last
    <br />
    about GSW, Margo indicated that she thought the launch should be handled
    <br />
    in parallel by the migration team; has she changed her mind about that?
    <br />
    Has she spoken with LindaT, do you know?
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;BH: I do not know. She did say &quot;unless we have the cycles...&quot; so maybe
    <br />
    she was still entertaining the notion.
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;AdeV: OK. I'll ask her about that when I meet with her tomorrow
    <br />
    morning.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    BIR - MK: why 25%, rather than less?&nbsp; I couldn't remember.
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;AdeV: I'm happy to reset this one at 20% (3 sites + 1 umbrella) if
    <br />
    Margo agrees; I don't recall why I thought this would be more challenging
    <br />
    than a typical multi-site migration.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    Inline audio - Thought Bill might want to contract to Andrea L?
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    CHEST Meeting abs - Doesn't seem to MK to need a PjM.
    <br />
    We had problems last year, moving from meeting abstracts into CHEST site
    <br />
    itself.&nbsp; But now it's done.&nbsp; Between Chris Abbott and Bryan or Chris C,
    <br />
    PjM work won't be excessive.&nbsp; Leave with PbM?
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;AdeV: Jean specifically requested a PjM, but if we don't got one,
    <br />
    hearing that this shouldn't be too difficult to manage makes it less
    <br />
    painful to try to push this one back.
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;BH: yes. and Margo actually volunteered to speak with her.

   I think, at this point, we've been taking on out of plan new items and
   <br />
   everything else that it would probably be foolish at this point to not grant
   <br />
   a one day reprieve.&nbsp; We should have been hardnosed from the beginning, but
   <br />
   we weren't so for a day, it would be silly to make a big deal out of a day,
   <br />
   now.
   <br />
   <br />
   Next time (w/them or anyone else)
   <font>
    we need to lock down the
    <br />
    Requirements at the beginning and then put it under change control.&nbsp; ANY (yes, ANY!!!) change from the originally &quot;frozen&quot; Requirements requires change control approvals from both sides.&nbsp; My expectations on any change is that there will be a cost, nothing is free (time and/or resources).&nbsp; We need
    <br />
    to be disciplined from the start.

   ASNR/ajnr: Any new concerns this morning about what you're finding in QA?
   <br />
   Is the goal still to have Alan complete content loading this week, after
   <br />
   QA finishes up their review today? Are you working with Bernard on this
   <br />
   one, and/or do you feel like you need any additional support in dealing
   <br />
   with either the PbM or the customer?
   <br />
   <font>
    <br />
    No new concerns as of now.�� Xenia wants Morgan to finish the QA today
    <br />
    before Alan starts loading the volumes.�� I am working with Bernard on this.
    <br />
    <font>
     <br />
     GSW/econgeo: I believe you said that you had customer approval on the
     <br />
     sample content. Did QA review the pan-era sample before Mike began
     <br />
     production loading? If so, were any problems reported? If not, let's talk
     <br />
     about how to deal with that. Looks like Mike has ~70 issues of ~840 loaded
     <br />
     to date. Has he confirmed that he will be content complete on 22 Sep, as
     <br />
     expected? Is the team ready to &quot;cut to prod&quot; on the 22nd, as well?
     <br />
     <font>
      <br />
      I will get an update from Mike Minarik to you on this.� We have a meeting at 1PM today.
      <br />
      <font>
       <br />
       SEPM/jsedres, palaios: Again, I believe you said that you had customer
       <br />
       approval on the sample content. Same question as above: has QA reviewed
       <br />
       the pan-era sample? Any problems? Looks like Mike has just 7 (5/jsedres +
       <br />
       2/palaios) of 565 (393 jsedres + 172 palaios) loaded to date. Has he
       <br />
       confirmed that he will be content complete on 22 Sep, as expected? Is the
       <br />
       team ready to &quot;cut to prod&quot; on the 22nd, as well?
       <br />
       <font>
        <br />
        <br />
        Update after Jsedres/Palaios/Econgeo/SSABull meeting:&nbsp; Deb is helping Mike Minarik by loading the content.
        <br />
        <br />
        Econgeo - content loading currently in progress -
        <br />
        Jsedres/Palaios - content loading to start after Econgeo - completion expected by Monday 9/26
        <br />
        <br />
        <font>
         <br />
         BSSA/ssabull: Sounds like the customer hasn't approved Beta, yet; is that
         <br />
         right? According to the schedule, we were supposed to have their approval
         <br />
         about a week ago. Can you update me on this one? We've lost about a week
         <br />
         of content loading time and there are ~514 issues to load.... Also, the
         <br />
         schedule indicates that we're supposed to cut to prod tomorrow, but if
         <br />
         launch has moved to 13 Oct I think we should cut to prod on 28 or 29 Sep,
         <br />
         instead. I'm confused! Please help.
         <br />
         <font>
          <br />
          Trying to get the customer signoff on beta and content.�� Had to clarify some
          <br />
          items today with them.� Expecting to get that today.
          <br />
          SSABull - Will start after Jsedres/Palaios.�� No completion date given by Mike.
          <br />
          <font>
           <br />
           ASH/bloodbook+umbrella: This one went to Beta yesterday, I believe. Please
           <br />
           let me know where I can find the feedback spreadsheet(s)!
           <br />
           <font>
            <br />
            Yes, also walked the publisher through the site notes and what is expected of
            <br />
            them during beta.
            <br />
            <font>
             <br />
             AJS/ajs: Did this go to Alpha this week? If so, please let me know where I
             <br />
             can find the feedback spreadsheet. Also, it looks to me like this journal
             <br />
             has yet to transition to NLM XML. Are you able to provide an update on
             <br />
             that work? I don't see any sample issues in HWX-demo/H1O-dev, and it looks
             <br />
             like it's still on the &quot;not firm&quot; tab here:

              content and Ramsi has received feedback on that.

        <br />
        <br />
        Some times based on importance and when I feel thorough professional QA is needed, I give alpha and beta to musikaar as well. Some times when local QA is on leave or busy with multiple tasks, I also assign alpha/beta to musikaar, if they are free.
        <br />
        <br />
        There is some value with local QA. There is a good value with remote QA. So I mix as appropriate.

        Hi Marc,
        <br />
        ��� Since formal QA is new at HighWire, publication managers may not have been fully conversant with the process/procedures of QA. Sometimes when Project Managers are involved, they handle all aspects of migration and launches. In such cases publication managers get less chance to be directly involved with QA process. But when publication managers also act as project managers, they have to adhere to QA process and use QA resources timely. In the last two months, I observed two instances of QA not being involved in migration as intended. So I thought I should send short email on QA processes so that publication managers can ensure QA processes are followed strictly.
        <br />
        <br />
        1.
        <b>
         <font>
          QA on alpha site
         </font>
        </b>
        <font>
         before publisher beta focusing mostly on loaded recent era NLM samples and specific design spec if sought by publisher and agreed to be done as part of migration. This
         <font>
          happens one week before publisher beta.
          <font>
           After samples are loaded by content analyst and JD prepares the site, the publication manager/project manager requests start of QA.
           <br />
           <br />
           2.
           <b>
            <font>
             QA on content site
            </font>
           </b>
           <font>
            for previous era samples and OM samples along with publisher beta. After the samples are loaded by the content analysts using content site prepared by the JD, the publication manager/project manager requests the start of content sample QA. This happens
            <font>
             two or three days after the start of publisher beta
             <font>
              . If it starts on the
              <i>
               <font>
                same day
               </font>
              </i>
              <font>
               as publisher beta, it is ideal. This needs to be done
               <font>
                before full content loading starts.
                <font>
                 <br />
                 <br />
                 3.
                 <b>
                  <font>
                   Pre-launch QA on beta site
                  </font>
                 </b>
                 <font>
                  supposed to start
                  <font>
                   two weeks before launch date.
                   <font>
                    QA will start this testing after getting an email from publication manager/project manager after all content is loaded, URL mapping is done and all the feasible changes are done to incorporate publisher feedback.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    4.
                    <b>
                     <font>
                      Launch day QA
                     </font>
                    </b>
                    <font>
                     . This is a short acceptance level of QA along with couple of tests that can happen� only after launch.
                     <br />
                     <br />
                     Since we have limited number of QA resources and two QA resources(Morgan Pugh, and Jessica Apperson) work part time while being full time students, I need prompt information on schedules and changes. QA requires two days of testing time and elapsed time of 1 week for the above 1, 2, 3 QA steps. Apart from these QA, QA also does OUP books QA, NLM transitions QA, and Installable QA prep to aid Publication Managers.
                     <br />
                     <br />
                     Thanks and regards,
                     <br />

  21:09 &lt;bh&gt; OK, I'll stick my neck out: does this technique work when there is no &quot;common&quot; character to swap? Ex., with a glyph gif? I assume .... not?
  <br />
  21:11 &lt;ian&gt; i set it up to be configurable to replace any character or string with any alternate (character, string, or markup)
  <br />
  21:11 &lt;ian&gt; so &quot;sure&quot;
  <br />
  21:11 &lt;ian&gt; the map is currently internal to the site, though, so we have to do a site update to change the character rewrite mapping
  <br />
  ...
  <br />
  21:15 &lt;bh&gt; you said &quot;is currently internal to the site...&quot; does that mean some day it might not be?
  <br />
  21:16 &lt;Rachel&gt; I assume that means it's a file living within tomcat, so tomcat needs to be restarted every time it's updated
  <br />
  21:16 &lt;ian&gt; yeah, we could move it out to staticfs so we could edit it live

      Bill might know the preocess, Dennis will, Mark J is you best bet
      <br />
      Everything revolves around talking to Geraldine. DON'T GO TO WEB SITE WITHOUT GERALDINE ON THE PHONE. Forms there are pathetic.&nbsp; Only a tiny amount is needed.
      <br />
      We do start people w/o filling out in Filling manpower, and without opening a req.
      <br />
      We start people without having them in the system for WEEKS. DS and MB just recently.

      GERALDINE is the only important one.
      <br />
      Can try cell.
      <br />
      $60-$80 to the contractor is OK

      26% over that to Manpower

                 If they give you a range, and it's OK, go with high end (55 to 60), but for shorter term, go with lower, if it's high.&nbsp; Don't want them looking for somethign else while they work with me.

                   Do we commit to a given length of time with contractors? &quot;at least 6 months&quot; or something?
                   <br />
                   And do we expect a fixed # of hours a day, or do they bill monthly based on their actual hours?

  13:12 &lt;bh&gt; Dharm, I don't think I'd share the &quot;Lucene solution&quot; with the internal team ahead of time. First off, some might think it puts the cart before the horse. Secondarily, Project Managers don't do design here - at least not formally. We don't want to step on any toes!&nbsp; There will be opportunities to share with the team, but I don't think we should *start* with it.
  <br />
  13:18 &lt;dsingh&gt; ok, that is why I thought I will check with you first!
  <br />
  13:18 &lt;bh&gt; very good.

   Storytelling
   <br />
   - was &quot;Medical Explorer Scout&quot;. Was going to go to Med Scho. Coll San Mateo, then to UC Berkeley.&nbsp; But decided medicine was not for him. Got into music, playing and writing, two times spoke to serious record labels.
   <br />
   Wrote a system for family business
   <br />
   Worked at apple for a few years. Took classese there.
   <br />
   Managing environmental test labs (heat rooms, test chambers). Put services under network control.
   <br />
   Biannual APple layoffs. No where to go in that divsion, asked for it.
   <br />
   When to Storage Dimensions working for tech support group. Built very early web site, for querying on device.
   <br />
   Friend called me to Sega, knew Macs well. Bad career choice, horrible hours, bad pay.&nbsp; THen that division closed down.

   <br />
   Brought the internal group to external group standards (ex., PHP, repository, etc)
   <br />
   Then focused more on
   <br />
   Then butted heads with VP of the group. ... analytic tools for modifying search results in real time.... So I moved to the Search group. After a few months there, a big round of Yahoo! layoffs.
   <br />
   Then I decided to go PjM.
   <br />
   LiveOps, call center platform.&nbsp; managing with ... software dev.... core platform upgrades.... Op center...
   <br />
   Very challenging environment, telecomm is more rigid than web to engineer.&nbsp; And lots of culture change to hew to audit.&nbsp; Focus more and more on enterprise customers.

                x I think that kind of environment is becoming more commonplace.&nbsp; @ Yahoo!, working with lots of different groups (inputs and outputs), with different styles, and which I had no influence over. Groups that worked differently.
                <br />
                Even more at LiveOps. That was chaotic. Unsettled, that became the norm.

      <font>
       <br />
       <br />
       zk: civic actions was very busy. never enough money .&nbsp;&nbsp; Prioritize and keeping projects moving.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tricky when you're moving on 5 projects at once.&nbsp; Corporate to startup to nonprofits. Breadth of experience means I now how project flow. Client expectation management, communication clarity.
       <br />
       Lots of chaos
       <br />
       <font>
        <br />

           <br />
           zk: web dev @ civic actions, etc.
           <br />

                <font>
                 <br />
                 Really like agile/scrum.&nbsp; Civic actions we used scrum.&nbsp; I've done lots of UX. ...
                 <br />
                 Scrum: product owner, UI, &quot;project manager role&quot;. Range of roles.
                 <br />
                 HW [should] look for a template to apply in their Drupal sites.&nbsp;&nbsp; But no two projects are identical.

  Life at KP
  <br />
  - revamping intranet. was higgly piggly. Launches later this year.
  <br />
  180k employees. Federated, regions autonomous
  <br />
  Biz proj management, to help internal clients who are converting over to the new system.&nbsp; PR, corporate comm, brand strategy customers. I define platform to be useful for them. I have *some* CMS background.
  <br />
  I have biz analyst, and technical project person assigned, now I have a biz side Project manager too. Acceptance testing, etc. Comm strategy and plan is big part.&nbsp; So KP &quot;migration&quot;.
  <br />
  <br />
  KP PjM is immature in my area. We have a lot of PMI certified PjMs, but not with experience. Management doesn't appreciate the need for risk lists and schedules etc. Fairly loose. I end up mentoring our PjMs.&nbsp; Hard skill and Soft skill.
  <br />
  We are redefining intake process in Visio.

    PjM QUESTIONS
    <br />
    <br />
    <font>
     * What kinds of web-centric projects have you managed?
     <font>
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <font>
       * extremely fast-paced,&nbsp; somewhat chaotic: give me concrete examples
       <font>
        <br />
        - not the aggressiveness of schedules that causes anxiety, it's the amount of chaos.&nbsp; It's competing demands and expectations, ex., on people. Makes it difficult, even if you know exactly what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a problem beyond HW.
        <br />
        I don't have enough info to assess that. Resource constraints are common. At Hitachi, they had that in spades. Single person bottlenecks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Replacements would have to be self-training.
        <br />
        &quot;So we put it on the shelf.&quot;
        <br />
        Pressure from sales guys... &quot;have to do this...&quot;....
        <br />
        ..Symantec 2nd stint was called in to recalibrate project, re-estimate it, etc., ... aggressive plan, trying to retain as much of earlier commitment as possible.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <font>
         * have you help org's move towards normal business process?
         <font>
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <font>
           * have you worked with a team of PjMs? in a PMO?
           <font>
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <font>
             * We need a really quick start from this incumbent.&nbsp; Can you give me an example where you picked up a project and hit the ground running? How?
             <br />
             <font>
              <br />
              <br />
              <font>
               * How was scheduling managed at the organizational level at a previous job? How did you fit in?
               <font>
                <br />
                <br />
                - I have thoughts. Sounds like people are split across multiple projects, and not loaded properly. 100% of same person on multiple projects?
                <br />
                - Wrk estimates must be disciplined, with some confidence estimates
                <br />
                - need a means of prioritizing across projects. Need accurate resource loading.
                <br />
                - you need a consolidated master schedule. You can do a variety of ways. MS Project server does it.&nbsp; PPM tools, like one we used at Hitachi (&quot;Changepoint&quot;).&nbsp; Need to review time phasing.
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                * DIrect customers contact?
                <br />
                - Extensive. FIrst half of my career had a lot of full-life cycle support, visits.
                <br />
                My PM career has centered around internal customer (i.e., &quot;IT projects&quot;). So my customer is a Senior VP, for instance.

                    <br />
                    - Of course, maybe &quot;I&quot; was the colleague!
                    <br />
                    I haven't had that many difficult peers. I've had difficult reports. Ex, personality quirks, poor interpersonal skills, that wear on the team. Intermural conflict.&nbsp; Will take it to the individual person, and have a dialog.&nbsp; Ex., brilliant, sarcastic engineer. Pissed off customers.&nbsp; I explained that he was undermining himself, and gave him concrete examples.
                    <br />
                    I've had to negotiate maturely with our peers - that's a competition. If we have a clear sense of business priority, it's not hard.
                    <br />
                    I've had good luck in my PjM career. hasn't had that so much. Have had a difficult 3rd party vendor.

  <br />
  =====
  <br />
  <br />
  Take: Seems good.&nbsp; a little less customer-facing experience, but nothing I'd fear.
  <br />
  Thoughtful, articulate. Probably a good fit.
  <br />
  <br />
  FUTURE QUEX:
  <br />
  * how would you chracterize yourself as a program manager?
  <br />
  <br />
  - somewhere between really agressive and realaly passive
  <br />
  <br />
  - very experienced with pulling requirements together, analyzing, breaking down, and tracking
  <br />
  <br />
  - no longer feels he's a &quot;technologist&quot;, he stopped keeping up at .net, skipped &quot;MVC&quot;, etc.
  <br />
  <br />
  - JP Morgan w2nd stint was too much banker rather than programmer focus.
  <br />
  <br />
  * ADP experience probably most applicable Large %&nbsp; was Pjm. MS Project.&nbsp; &quot;I love it.&quot;
  <br />
  Haven't used the financial stuff. Costing.
  <br />
  Resource mgmt. = set up scheduls; assign to tasks w/schedules;&nbsp; view utilization; Level by resource
  <br />
  = the MS Project &quot;feed the beast&quot; problem. Used project server, I imported the hours daily from my team. Kept tasks floating (not anchoring!).&nbsp; compliance - &quot;If you have a big enough whip!&quot;
  <font>
   They reported Hours on each project, AND the % remaining.
   <font>
    &nbsp; Built in to MS Project server itself.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    ===
    <br />
    Eric
    <br />
    team lead and coder
    <br />
    pretty smart, architected and coded big Stanford project. Worked for Bill
    <br />
    <br />
    Stubborn sometimes if customers wanted to change spec's. Dev teams were fine with him.
    <br />
    <br />
    articulate
    <br />
    organized
    <br />
    hard worker.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    ===
    <br />
    Yes, he worked for me the whole time I was at Context. He also worked with Eric and Eric has some opinions about him that would be worth checking. Pretty smart guy and definitely been around IT for a long time. He was part of the team I had working on the big project for Barry Reuter (Stanford Housing &amp; Dining).
    <br />
    <br />
    Talk with Eric about him while I think about him. He might be good as a contract person to get us through some projects for a while.
    <br />
    <br />
    Bill
    <br />
    <br />
    ===================================================================================
    <br />
    * ask about people skills (patience, difficult coworkers, resource constraints)
    <br />
    Difficult customer:
    <br />
    Stanford Project at Context Integration. Some difficult customers. Ever-changing requirements, pie-in-the-sky design. I tried to be patient, and listen, and coaching.&nbsp; Understanding what was possible.
    <br />
    Used to do quite a bit of documentation, to help to the SOW's.&nbsp; Try to get consensus.
    <br />
    <br />
    Difficult coworker: woman who was my nemesis for a while.&nbsp; Had an executive coach at the time, who coached me through it. He recommended I envision her with her family, as a mother, being a human being, not just nasty. See her value.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I did a lot of visualization.&nbsp; It helped quite a bit! x2.&nbsp; I was more empathetic to her eneds, etc.
    <br />
    <br />
    * how does he feel about direct customer contact?
    <br />
    BG: I've had a fair amount of customer-like contact. at perquest, ADP, travelseek I had a product manager, who represented the customer to development.&nbsp; I had finance and marketin and operations reporting as customers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did at Stanford, too.
    <br />
    <br />
    As an ongoing proposition, I'm fine with it.&nbsp; IT would be good to b able to deal directly with customers.
    <br />
    <br />
    =====================================
    <br />
    <br />
    BG: Organizational change -
    <br />
    <br />
    - examples of times he felt good/didn't re: customer management...
    <br />
    <br />
    ==PMI
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    * ask about project management per se (ex., &quot;PMI&quot;-like; loathe to say &quot;waterfall&quot;)
    <br />
    <br />
    CSM
    <br />
    <br />
    ============================
    <br />
    <br />
    * recnelty worked at perquest. SaaS payroll. 1st hire.
    <br />
    * Software dev (C#, asp, etc), three jobs-
    <br />
    Source control model expert, release management work (including scripting)
    <br />
    Configuring QA an dproduction environemnt
    <br />
    Project managing offshore team on flexible spending
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    [very articulate; like the QA/release planning]
    <br />
    <br />
    Whiel at ADP, reengineered dev process. From ad hoc, to planned. put in place
    <font>
     Change Review Board.
     <font>
      <br />
      ... created model of queue of work in progress and to do; when change were introduced, I could introduce the changes into the model;
      <br />
      Implemented project server; automated updates to teams, etc. Near real-time model of what was goign on with my teams.
      <br />
      * also did a lot of pjm at ADP. Hundreds of small projects on his plan.
      <br />
      * at ADP did RUP (I called it Agile)
      <br />
      * a lot of itneresting.
      <br />
      * My future is technical management
      <br />
      <br />
      RUP: I like it. Used to like it quite a bit. now I like Scrum better. I like the iterative nature. You don't need te monolithic document.
      <br />
      Like Scrum better because has more well-defined process, with less ceremony and paperwork.
      <br />
      Limitations of scrum: 7+/-2; need dedicated product owner;

  * Ancient greek degree - so I went to work on the internet
  <br />
  - did not enjoy graduate school; didn't want to be english prof like my mom
  <br />
  - got job on trade mag.&nbsp; ;&nbsp; Became editor.
  <br />
  Lexis/Nexus. had to learn SGML to work w/Lexis/Nexus
  <br />
  Then found another SGML job. Early web design. HTML
  <br />
  PMP training on the job
  <br />
  &quot;harmonize the software&quot; the 30 offices
  <br />
  SOW... implementation rollout...
  <br />
  Users hated the implementation. After that I became an Agile devotee

  <br />
  Carbon market.... fincnacial crisis layoff
  <br />
  moved to CA at friend's recommendation
  <br />
  want to do something more interesting than Search (google)
  <br />
  <br />
  Cisco did
  <br />
  <br />
  On contracts since I got to CA.&nbsp;&nbsp; 2009 ...

  <br />
  * Trajectory?
  <br />
  <br />
  I grew up professionally with the internet.
  <br />
  <br />
  Waterfall doesn't work. $1m disaster/ Out of date, bloated, over priced
  <br />
  <br />
  I got the PMI training, 3 days with slideshow.
  <br />
  &quot;I find the standard modes of training to be woefully inadequate&quot;
  <br />
  <br />
  ITIL has its own strong training programming.&nbsp; Certified
  <br />
  At misys we were all ITL. But ITIL was the waterfall.
  <br />
  Very cumbersome stuff.
  <br />
  <br />
  BH: &quot;In what contexts doesn't Agile work?&quot;
  <br />
  <br />
  <font>
   [none...] &quot;Agile is simplified lean.&quot;
   <font>
    &nbsp; On a few teams won't benefit
    <br />
    <br />
    BH: delivered to external deadlines?&nbsp; template projects (like migrations)?
    <br />
    <br />
    Working at cisco, on &quot;facebook&nbsp; for the corporation&quot;. Lots of external partners for documentum.&nbsp; Agile worked well.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Fortune: My impression was that this was for an Agile project manager.
    <br />
    Like many Agilistas, i'm not interested. I DON&quot;T DO WATERFALL AND WOULDN'T BE INTERESTED
    <br />
    &quot;I have a profound love of agile, and always champion its use.&quot;
    <br />
    <font>
     &quot;So I suggest we just end this conversation now....&quot;
     <br />
     <br />
     ACTION: I said i would clarify my understanding of the job description. blah blah
     <br />
     TELL RON
     <font>
      <br />
      <br />
      What a pompous twit.
      <br />
      <br />
      * Interest in HW?
      <br />
      <br />
      * where does scrum apply? where not?
      <br />

                      Mahesh is a software engineer who has taken up project management in his last three jobs. I'm forwarding two resumes for him - given the odd job titles various companies have and the recent economy, it may take both to figure that out - to see that he spent 3 years project managing web apps in the mortgage industry (his second-last job) - and even then you may not see that he spent a year in a UC Santa Cruz program getting a PjM certification. I've spoken with him via phone; Margo, Xenia and I concur he's worth interviewing.�

                      <br />

                      This would be to PjM migrations, so I have not included Anh or Matt.

  Dharm is a Project Manager (w/ mobile device exp) who's very sharp, has good comm skills, and open to a contract position. Here are the notes he sent me that specifically refer to his mobile exp:
  <br />
  <br />
  Hi Val,
  <br />
  <br />
  Here is my recent experience of working with mobile apps.
  <br />
  <br />
  I have done two projects directly developing mobile apps. In addition,
  <br />
  I have documented functional requirements for one mobile app. I have
  <br />
  worked on a Project with SMS push solution. The details are as
  <br />
  follows:
  <br />
  <br />
  1. Mobile App Project: ISsquared, Inc 2011. As part of the IT
  <br />
  integration project, a mobile app for Windows Mobile was built as an
  <br />
  internal social networking app. The app was to connect with the
  <br />
  internal (intranet) social networking site that shared informal info
  <br />
  for internal job openings and other items.
  <br />
  2. Mobile App Project: Global IT Partners, Inc 2009-2010. Involved in
  <br />
  the project of improving the IPhone App for Yahoo Shopping.
  <br />
  3. Mobile App Project/ Wrote Functional Requirements: ISsquared, Inc
  <br />
  2010. Wrote the FRD for the mobile app. The project was later shelved.
  <br />
  4. SMS push to Mobile Phones: ISsquared, Inc: The website project
  <br />
  involve the mass SMS push solution to mobile phones.
  <br />
  <br />

    How different here:

     <br />
     <br />
     <font>
      * How do you think [project] managing at HW would differ from managing at&nbsp; your previous post?&nbsp; [ formality of org / formal authority / depth of resources / pace ]
      <br />
      <font>
       <br />
       DS: HW deals wtih publishers. The # of customers is higher than a typical project.&nbsp; And there are concurrent projects.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, integration of existing assets.
       <br />
       transition- migration - integration.

            <br />
            Stanford is good name. and mobile apps.&nbsp; Permanent opportunity at Stanford.&nbsp; Some kind of fascination. I wanted to to Masters&nbsp; MBA here (I didn't get an MS). At home it was Oxford or Cambridge.

              * What's your level of technical involvement when you manage technically complex projects?
              <br />
              <br />
              * What do you know about SDLC? (Agile, Kanban, Lean)
              <br />
              * Have you USED them for manging projects? when/where/how many?

               DS:&nbsp; at Exodus, there were multiple departments who had to sign off on a project. Systems, file storage, facilities etc etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these areas were bottlenecks.
               <br />
               Used Siebold CRM. We used ticketing system in Siebold.&nbsp; Ticket went from one department to the next.&nbsp; We had notion of &quot;turnover time&quot;, time to complete a standard action. Sort of internal SLA.&nbsp; Provided range of days for all standard actions.&nbsp; Naturally serialized b/c of the product provisioning.&nbsp; But these were standardized tasks.
               <br />
               Development tasks still need estimates. And you have to monitor and check.
               <br />
               ...MS Project, copy into agenda, etc etc.
               <br />

                * What was resource contention like at your previous job?&nbsp; How was it managed?
                <br />
                <br />
                * At HW it is almost impossible to create dedicated development teams. How can Agile be applied in that framework?
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                * direct client support - what kind of one face-to-face customer service with paying customers?
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />

                 <br />
                 DS: MS Project has lots of bells and whistles. That scares people away. I use 15% of its features. Task, schedule, baseline. That's it.
                 <br />
                 <font>
                  <br />

                    <br />
                    Ex., 10 years ago, ... lots of examples....

  RS: Jiawei... books branch so far out of date, 1st gen code
  <br />
  H2O books...
  <br />
  <br />
  Books modeled as H2O books:
  <br />
  ERM, aptaguide, sepm (4 series); Another set coming in october
  <br />
  <br />
  Journal and book platforms are now out of sync, books are 18 months out of sync. Two different codebases.&nbsp; Books was originally a hacked journal branch.
  <br />
  Pain in the ass to do. We need a better way.
  <br />
  <br />
  Vision was always to merge books back in.
  <br />
  <br />
  RS: It would be months of someone's work to reinterate. And we'd still be in danger of breaking.
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ:&nbsp; I think we want these products to diverge. But there is commonality.&nbsp; Could there be an abstract layer, that each have as an external...?
  <br />
  RS: no, books content was so different. Low level, getting content differences....
  <br />
  RS: Not full featured, not great, etc.
  <br />
  <br />
  AB: So we're months of gettign this fixed
  <br />
  CJ: It's not a problem that they products will drift.&nbsp; Cut the cord. DIfferent products.
  <br />
  Niz: Forking is common. But danger is lowest common denominator functionality. That tips scale re: buy vs build.
  <br />
  <br />
  NN: The processing pipeline is the same situation.&nbsp; Critical distinction Journals 2.3 dtd, Books started on 3.0.&nbsp; Never extended to 3.0 journal dtd's.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  RS: We can go forward, doing with what we've been doing for now.
  <br />
  <br />
  AB: ppt downloading, reflinks, are part of what differentiates us , value we get from the journal system.
  <br />
  RFPs keep asking for integrated books and journals.
  <br />
  <br />
  NN/RS: It's not anemic, it's nascent.
  <br />
  NN: the books workflow isn't bad, the loading code is working well. But Only I know how to use it.
  <br />
  <br />
  GS: Massive amounts of commonality.
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ: Right. You can support that via inheritance from abstract base;&nbsp; complete fork with copy and paste;&nbsp; or use a mixin approach for features (component library, calling on shared atom content; compose rather than inheritance, which I prefer)
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ: ex., reflinks should be a component.
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ: Any of these would be difficult.
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ: Pure H2O launch for smpte, is thin edge of wedge for getting off h1O. Ex., loading data into reflinks.
  <br />
  <br />
  GS: Ex, Google Plus won't go into books this weekend.
  <br />
  <br />
  Niz: split becomes wider - between reality and marketing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had no idea the split was this large.
  <br />
  We're selling commonality between book and journal, and we can't deliver now.
  <br />
  <br />
  RS: &lt; 6 months of a senior person, for example
  <br />
  <br />
  NN: in content, we'd probably like to refactor to shared model, but we'd keep the codebases separate.

    <br />
    <br />
    RS: Science hardcodes SWF data,
    <br />
    CJ: They provision the entire experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; We don't have to do that for audio. We can provision the content, and leave it to the user support.
    <br />
    <br />
    RL: SO?
    <br />
    CJ: Need investigation still. Could we leverage Brightcove.
    <br />
    BW: Brightcove won't support near term audio-only, so we should focus on Limelight.
    <br />
    <br />
    TM: BW to write spec (# publishers, what formats, how display), Matt to vet for video. Then to tech team.&nbsp; Delivery date for that first article.
    <br />
    RS: need to know if Limelight has a player, what my embedding parameters are etc.
    <br />
    <br />
    Limelight: streaming flash, streaming windows (RMTP)
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    KH: modeling currently is awkward, b/c the DTD doesn't permit accommodating all of the parameters that the display layer needs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So we have &quot;supplemental&quot; approach we have now.

  CJ: need to have an identifier for incoming media, which we know before we have other info. &quot;Rich media assets&quot;
  <br />
  <br />
  Would like to use DOIs. Would like to do deposits of the materials.
  <br />
  <br />
  NN: Why DOI? what if a publisher doesn't want to pay?
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ: can be publisher ID, has to be universally unique.
  <br />
  <br />
  KH: tell 'em to toe the line.
  <br />
  <br />
  TM.... some are legally barred from DOI prefix... can't force it... DOIs ok 99% of the time.
  <br />
  <br />
  NN: we need knowable (and predictable?)&nbsp; primary key - we'll store it in some rdbms.
  <br />
  CJ: Yes. We need to hold DOI in relation to this primary key. FPage augmentation.
  <br />
  <br />
  NNN: we've also been asked for DOI support for issues and fragments
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ: Scope: provide DOI handling whereever it applies in the source.
  <br />
  <br />
  NN: They can send them now.
  <br />
  CJ: Who owns design of picking them out of hte db?
  <br />
  NN: .... backfill them into a relational db.
  <br />
  TM: Eric started this, Mike F finished it
  <br />
  CJ: This dovetails SMPTE H10 dependency. This will result in new content db that holds primary identifiers, like this.
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ: this dovetails w/SMPTE, and I need to pursue it.
  <br />
  CJ IS OWNER.
  <br />
  <br />
  =================
  <br />
  <br />
  MK: example of RFP
  <br />
  AB: Where's the RFP Group that Keller put on the board
  <br />
  <br />
  BW: It's inappropriate for WARP. WARP has another focus.
  <br />
  The RFP example has about 15 WARP-able items. But we don't do WARP until we're ready to do a design.
  <br />
  <br />
  ....
  <br />
  CJ: maybe PSC needs to be the guiding executive sponsor of this working group.

    Use folder Quick Filter in Thunderbird

This book details how the PMO applies professional project management practices and successfully integrates business interests with project goals. The Handbook focuses on establishing PMO functionality to meet the requirements of project stakeholders. It presents 20 pertinent PMO function models, providing guidance for developing PMO operating capability that is applicable to any organization. It also presents these functions relative to five stages of progressive PMO development, demonstrating potential PMO growth from simple project control up through its alignment within a strategic business framework.

  Things that make problems for Scrum
  <br />
  <br />
  * External dependencies break Scrum.&nbsp; Sometimes they're a fact of life.
  <br />
  The more dependencies we try to manage in advance, the more we make ourselves un-agile.
  <br />
  <br />
  * Many to Many Relationships
  <br />
  multiple, interrelated teams (product, portfolio, development, etc).&nbsp; Each scrum team relies on those below.
  <br />
  Team velocity is not a predictor of higher order deliverables in this environment.&nbsp; (for integrated deliverables)
  <br />
  Common with SOA, etc. systems.
  <br />
  <br />
  Business-level agility: Team-like agility across the entire company. &quot;Enterprise backlog&quot;. Rapid feedback, iteration, etc.
  <br />
  <br />
  - love Scrum at team level. Otherwise you need some other things
  <br />
  <br />
  Tools available to scale Scrum
  <br />
  * Scrump and XP
  <br />
  * Kanban
  <br />
  * Lean - value streams, reducing waste, latency, cycle time
  <br />
  * Rational Unified Process (RUP). Excellent ideas on phasing and risk management
  <br />
  * Traditional SDLC&nbsp; (waterfall)
  <br />
  <br />
  What to organize teams around? Possible
  <br />
  * components
  <br />
  * services
  <br />
  ...
  <br />
  <br />
  Establish Program teams and/or Product Integration Teams, Portfolio Planning
  <br />
  - structures within org to build team around
  <br />
  + Manage the flow of value at each level.
  <br />
  Teams at bottom of pyramid focus on velocity.&nbsp; Mid-tier level might not have corresponding velocity, or a stable velocity - less predictable here.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Epic =&gt; Feature =&gt; User Story
  <br />
  Epic 1-3 mo, Features 2-4 wks, User Story 1-3 days (always fits in sprint)
  <br />
  deliver value early and often
  <br />
  <br />
  How do we relate team level velocity and enterprise flow of value?
  <br />
  Tier 3 - RUP [ Inception / Elaboration / Construction / Transition] (could be something other than RUP)
  <br />
  Tier 2 - Kanban [analysis / design / build / test / deploy]
  <br />
  Tier 1 - Scrum
  <br />
  <br />
  Wrap scrum in Kanban to create &quot;pull&quot; system across portfolio.
  <br />
  <br />
  ==============
  <br />
  <br />
  TC: We could use Kanban at the Migration level.&nbsp; Kanban reveals the bottlenecks.

   <br />
   PO should be role, not job title.
   <br />
   &quot;Discovery of the right thing to build is the most important step in creating a good product. Get that wrong and you have achieved 100% waste. Delegating decisions about what to build to a single Product Owner is outsourcing the most important work of the development team to a person who is unlikely to have the skills or knowledge to make really good decisions. The flaw in many Product Owner implementations is the idea that the Product Owner prepares detailed stories for the team to implement. This does not allow
   <font>
    team members to be partners
    <font>
     and collaborators in designing the product.&quot;
     <br />

     <br />
     <br />
     Aslam Khan:&nbsp; Product owners should provide opportunities for team to communicate direclty with customers, (mediated by PO, of course).
     <br />
     <br />
     PO should focus on &quot;what&quot;, but be prepared to talk about &quot;why&quot;
     <br />
     Team should focus on &quot;how&quot;, but also need to understand the business context.
     <br />
     <br />
     For AK, PO is less about feature and story framing, and more about tactical decision making to fulfill a strategy
     <br />
     <br />
     AK: feedback loops needs to be designed uniquely for each organization, and product, and strategy
     <br />
     <br />
     PO must be an info radiator (shareholders, investors, etc), as well as a sink
     <br />
     AK: I talk about Product Ownership (the role), not the Product Owner (a single person)
     <br />

     Most problems are contextual.
     <br />
     <br />
     Forget old rules that PO can't speak at standups. Etc.
     <br />
     <br />
     May need a &quot;backlog workshop&quot; once a week or every other, to do missing estimation, looking over the backlog for problems, etc.
     <br />
     <br />
     A &quot;Chief product owner&quot; might be useful in cross-team coordination .etc.&nbsp; And settle priorities across the team.
     <br />
     <br />
     Also supports multiple PO's (Role, not person). Sometimes two P(O's are good, one internal facing, the other external facing, - so long as they are attached back to back.

  Time based estimates are not additive!&nbsp; That's why Mike likes story points.
  <br />
  My estimate might be based on my skill levels, which are different from yours. We can agree on the size of the task, but we will differ in getting it done.
  <br />
  <br />
  * You can't take hours you pulled out of the air (i.e., idealized hours in backlog), and compare them directly to hours you've &quot;thought a lot about&quot; (i.e., tasks hour estimated in the current iteration)

  And you certainly can't divide the one into the other to get duration.

       How is velocity calculated?
      </font>
     </b>
     <font>
      <br />
      Velocity is the sum of the estimates of delivered (i.e., accepted) features per iteration.

       <font>
        <br />
        What unit is used to measure velocity?
       </font>
      </b>
      <font>
       <br />
       Velocity is measured in the same units as feature estimates, whether this is story points, days, ideal days, or hours - all of which are considered acceptable.

  RL: Making it less and less appropriate for you
  <br />
  * experience working in every kind of house and housing development
  <br />
  * experience in so many places that nothing stymied him

  + Working with Niz, re: &quot;Infra&quot; on color block chart. Two parts...
  <br />
  1 When we're done w/mig, we still have debt
  <br />
  2 what does it mean that we're on h2o? Not on customer or product standpoint. The technology roadmap. RL has lead those before.&nbsp; Parallel to product roadmap.
  <br />
  <br />
  1 Product roadmap: has customer and prod
  <br />
  2 Technology roadmap: the platform. Needs CTO to guide it.&nbsp; Facilitation challenge of that. CTO: fixes, opportunities, backlog, etc.&nbsp; Knowing where it goes relative to the product teams.
  <br />
  3 Infrastructure: Syops, data center, etc.
  <br />
  <br />
  Niz is &quot;open to&quot; having conversation about it.

   - needing to meet with everyone and figure out what needs to change.&nbsp; Gotta get people who know things to talk to each other.
   <br />
   That's a hump of time requirements.&nbsp; Then, 3-5 months from now, not clear what kind of maintenance of the process is needed.
   <br />
   <br />
   RL did technology roadmap at Checkpoint, started by getting product manager (who were good) opinions. Then a monthly meeting. Then called experts in as they were needed.&nbsp; Then, the product managers completely changed their minds about what was needed.
   <br />
   <br />
   * Immediate challenge to figure out what they position would involved.
   <br />
   Who has to be on it? Who has to be socialized on it?
   <br />
   <br />
   * Should BH be at warp, should BH be there?
   <br />
   * Environmental change&quot; on Mike's chart; because &quot;infrastructure&quot; (KFR) or &quot;platform (RL); need to figure out who needs to be involved to define;

   <br />
   Add this CTO stuff to my plate, I have no more time.
   <br />
   When Platforms is more under control....
   <br />
   Between now and 4 months from now, think about this organization as a flow of opportunities;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think about how to get rudders on the rafts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Think of Ron as RL to find things , to socialize it with, find connections.
   <br />
   There are people who aren't Dir, who Dir look at as &quot;Thought leaders&quot; (sort of); I'm one of two of those, to be much more impactful. My interest in PMO is an example (pushed RL to say &quot;Why am I not&quot;; ) I want you to be impactful;
   <br />
   Leverage Ron, so I don't have to [utilize formal authority to horn in on things] ...
   <br />
   &quot;I see this problem, it seems to not be moving ahead, I'd like to move it ahead...&quot;

  1. to RL: tell me more about what I would be doing if I were a member of this team, but not running it
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - RL said he and KFR would still want to benefit from my input. How? in what capacity? formal or informal?

  <br />
  3. how to handle the resource crush
  <br />
  4. how working with Xenia
  <br />
  5. the list of members, only lb and adv are strong
  <br />
  6. what is the universe of problems? migrations+what; then what mix?
  <br />
  7. how to do the Project Management training?
  <br />
  8. what kind of outreach to ex. HW PMI people outside of the core group?
  <br />
  9. what % of hours on direct PM, vs PMO duties?

  London update.. KFR, LP, Niz
  <br />
  <br />
  Niz twice presented
  <br />
  Jon, Helen, Esther, Ian
  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;It's a winnable account.&quot;&nbsp; They're in very deep with us.
  <br />
  <br />
  =&gt; KFR clearly is the executive sponsor in evil Ian's eyes.
  <br />
  =&gt; evil Ian does not want to work with John Sack.
  <br />
  <br />
  Jon thought he wanted APIs, but he wasn't clear why (see below, Niz doesn't want to do them w/o a forcing factor)
  <br />
  Jon wanted to Xquery&nbsp; Mark Logic directly. Not practical
  <br />
  <br />
  Helen K thinks we've shut only them out
  <br />
  In truth,&nbsp; we have stability, security, performance, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's those &quot;managerial&quot; aspects that make implementation a medium-sized project, rather than a smaller one
  <br />
  <br />
  * GIVE DANIEL the tools, he's great!&nbsp; He loved talking to Ian.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  re: the technical liaison role:
  <br />
  - evil Ian asked for it
  <br />
  - ? IB, RS, feed design etc
 -for questions like media types, header changes, etc
  <br />
  - first level filter
  <br />
  - Jon wants to talk Java to techies.
  <br />
  - Someone who has pull, can get things changed
  <br />
  - Don't want CTO, don't want message-taker
  <br />
  - at times their questions needs apps (IB),&nbsp; systems (JR, CJ) or Drupal (Niz) help.
  <br />
  <br />
  * Esther said Xenia was stellar
  <br />
  <br />
  * Niz would like to join some pre-executive meeting tech briefings, to get the techie-to-techie questions taken care of before evil Ian is in the room, for whom they all have to posture. For Jon, Daniel, Helen
  <br />
  <br />
  * Niz could do it, but he has inbound CTO role to manage (as well as pieces of high-level outbound CTO, which he likes)
  <br />
  * Niz would like to outsource lower priorities that we can't get to. revenue sharing to finance a tech intermediary position
  <br />
  <br />
  Need a tech rep who can go places w/PMs
  <br />
  <br />
  bmj.com redesign
  <br />
  - They are exploring basing it on Drupal. March target. Chrsitina has wireframes of what it might look like.
  <br />
  * Niz has promised we'd be able to deliver article content via a Drupal module.
  <br />
  - Jon wanted to avoid another in-house CMS (Plone, .., etc). So he was going to build a java framework. (!)
  <br />
  - Niz needs to get Drupal mobile, file manager moving so he's in a position to help bmj.com succeed.
  <br />
  <br />
  API
  <br />
  - make them define what &quot;API&quot; means. Jon is unclear.
  <br />
  ** Niz has a model in which we have a proxy interface to SASS, which pulls out our namespaced stuff, etc. But BMJ is concerned that we don't emaciate the content.
  <br />
  * data API, front by proxy is doable. But not trivial. (Performance, embargo, limit to access only BMJ content, etc). Proxy for SASS
  <br />
  <br />
  * Niz also things that RSS or atom feeds can serve a heck of a lot of this. Drupal is very facile w/RSS
  <br />
  <br />
  ** Niz thinks we could offer APIs for: Search, a/c, reporting and content.&nbsp; The last is what bmj.com needs
  <br />
  *** BMJ is doing their own a/c (!!)
  <br />
  - Nice is concerned that we don't do all the API definition work, and then have no one use it for years. Need forcing factor
  <br />
  <br />
  - Suggests we do a business requirements framework document, and also a skeletal or schematic &quot;spec&quot;. That way we'll be prepared. We'll have thought it through, and be ready to discuss.
  <br />
  <br />
  Drupal
  <br />
  * mobile, some filemanager.
  <br />
  ** &quot;It's an alternative&quot;

   </a>
   <br />
   <br />
   ron (Ron Lichty) posted the following content to the General forum:
   <br />
   <br />
   Summary:
   <br />
   On Wednesday, December 22, HighWire will initiate a site release process that will reduce the number of deployments by shifting all feature installs to a single change window each week. This is the site release process we announced in June. Feature installs will occur Wednesdays between 4-6pm Pacific Time. Java installs will be moved to the same Wednesday time to coincide. Production schedules, migrations and launches will be unaffected.
   <br />
   <br />
   What scheduled site deployments mean for you:
   <br />
   Your production schedule will be unaffected by this policy. New site launches and migrations will also be unaffected. Feature installation and site updates will now be done just once a week late afternoons on Wednesdays.&nbsp; Only sites requiring work will be affected by the weekly deployments.
   <br />
   <br />
   There will be some exceptions to weekly releases:
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work required for an embargoed issue to publish on time, and that cannot be scheduled ahead.
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical access issues preventing readers from accessing your content,
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feature releases that require a specific time and day and that cannot be scheduled ahead.
   <br />
   <br />
   Exceptions to the release schedule will be handled on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; Any work that is currently scheduled (that is, already has a specific release date) will not be affected.
   <br />
   <br />
   The vast majority of site work can and should be done in a planned and scheduled manner. We look to you to coordinate your business and technical needs with us as you have always done.
   <br />
   <br />
   Background:
   <br />
   This change was announced during our HighWire publisher meeting last June.* It was among a series of changes we described affecting our organizational structure, staff, and policies.
   <br />
   <br />
   What we announced then #0150; and are implementing now #0150; are regular site release windows. Sites that need to be updated will now be deployed during a scheduled weekly window rather than the previous array of ad hoc deployments.
   <br />
   <br />
   We are now in the process of implementing this strategy.&nbsp; On Wednesday, December 22, HighWire will begin scheduled weekly deployments during a weekly window on Wednesdays between 4-6pm Pacific Time.
   <br />
   <br />
   Benefits: Weekly scheduled deployments are more efficient &amp; will improve results:
   <br />
   Our goals for scheduled deployments are to improve our quality of work, increase productivity, and improve site stability as follows:
   <br />
   <br />
   Quality #0150; Weekly deployments allow for a more stable pattern of request, build, test, and deploy across our platform. This improves our work processes and the quality of output.&nbsp; It also increases the likelihood of discovering and addressing problems before they reach production.
   <br />
   <br />
   Productivity #0150; Weekly deployments save time. Our current ad hoc deployments take 40-60 hours per month. Fixing bugs triggered by the current ad hoc scheduling takes even more. That#0146;s time that can now be used for your site development.
   <br />
   <br />
   Stability #0150; Having fewer deployments reduces the downtime necessitated by site restarts. It also reduces load on servers, and the resulting risk of unintended outages.
   <br />
   <br />
   Best practices #0150; Because creating an even, steady development rhythm at a sustainable, constant pace itself reduces noise and improves predictability, quality and productivity, it has become an industry best practice.
   <br />
   <br />
   What Else - part of broader initiatives at HighWire to improve predictability and quality:
   <br />
   <br />
   Challenged by parallel demands for platform enhancements on top of migrating 1,400 journals and books to its new H2O platform, HighWire has been taking a series of initiatives this year to improve quality, efficiency, productivity, and predictability. In addition to scheduled deployments, they include:
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expanding QA both internally and with offshore resources
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increasing project management
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extending HighWire#0146;s use of QuickBase to be shared #0150; making it a collaborative tool you and we can use together
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initiating use of Agile methodologies
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creation of a Product Requirements Document to make it easier for you and us to #0147;get it right#0148; the first time
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adding additional depth to our post-project review process
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking to you, when you have multiple requests, tasks or projects, to prioritize them
   <br />
   <br />
   Establishing a reliable pattern of request, build, test, and release will allow HighWire to build more reliable and professional services for you.
   <br />
   <br />
   We believe this strategy has clear benefits for your site management. We welcome your input and questions. Please send questions to your Publication Manager.

   This is likely one where we�ll want to assign a Proj. Mgr., which of course is in Ron�s court.� If it�s a quick phone call, we (Craig, Margo, Greg,??) can/should probably find the time to spend an hour on the phone (perhaps led by either PbM or Project Mgr.), NOT taking on ANY commitments at this point, but answering their technical questions.� I�d try to schedule it after the LOA is signed.

                            They want to get started on the technical side of things (see below, they have &quot;technical questions about fulfillment&quot;).� I'm quite sure that Mark C does NOT want them to imprint on Craig Jurney.� (Craig was brought in as a Big Gun to help win the business, so that's why they know his name.)� Suggestions on the best way to approach this now?� Ron probably does not want them talking to Greg B or Alan A, either.� Mark J, is the next step to assign a PbM and let him/her filter the questions and direct them internally?� Shall I pushback and say no resource until LOA is signed?�

                                              Hi Sharon and Helen,
                                              <br />
                                              <br />
                                              I�ll be sending you a cleaned-up version of the LOA with a few more questions for you�hopefully, tonight.
                                              <br />
                                              <br />
                                              In the meantime, we have some technical questions about fulfillment and wondered if Paul Guerrero on our end could ask those questions directly of Craig Jurney? We don�t have his contact information, but thought we could keep the ball rolling on the LOA by letting Paul and him address Paul�s questions while you address our other remaining questions.
                                              <br />
                                              <br />
                                              Please advise.
                                              <br />
                                              <br />

             Hi, John --
             <br />
             <br />
             Just wanted you to know I had indeed received and read this, and appreciate
             <br />
             its delivery; it didn't fall into a black hole . . . Basically, it raises
             <br />
             some issues regarding relative stacking of organizational priorities that I can't really answer alone, so I'm seeking some additional feedback from
             <br />
             other folks. Will be back in touch as soon as possible.
             <br />
             <br />
             Thanks,
             <br />

             Stewart,
             <br />
             Sorry for the delay. �Marisol got assigned to jury duty for a trial that
             <br />
             will take the whole month of September, and Polly just got back. �Whew.
             <br />
             When we were talking about the possibility of co-development, we noted
             <br />
             that �the startup and support for this kind of thing trades off with the Signaling&nbsp; migration.
             <br />
             <br />
             (I'm trying to find where we wrote this down, but it might have been a
             <br />
             conversation not an email. �I hope this notion isn't a surprise. �Please let me know if �it is, and we can talk more about it.)
             <br />
             <br />
             So we'd like Science to tell us if we should take a month from the start
             <br />
             of �the Signaling project to set up a sandbox for you. �(True support of the sandbox �so you can be getting questions answered by us goes beyond setting up the sandbox.) �I think&nbsp; this is a reasonable tradeoff to make, but we need to get that confirmed. Once we set up a sandbox, we could arrange to have &quot;check in&quot; calls twice a �month until actual co-development begins. �I don't call this &quot;support&quot; since it isn't real
             <br />
             time support.
             <br />
             <br />
             <br />
             If you do choose to go with a sandbox set up, it really would be best for
             <br />
             us �to set it up when we are complete on the project for &quot;the other publisher&quot;; that will give you a more stable base to be working in. �That looks to be in November now. ��We can talk about this.
             <br />
             <br />
             Your note raises some other interesting questions (e.g., your team
             <br />
             working �on parts&nbsp; of Signaling). �I can see some �possibilities (e.g., a component for Signaling that needs to be developed in drupal, which is of interest to Science as well). But Todd's got to say if he can see how that would work. �What you are suggesting, I think, is some limited co-development *for Signaling*. �But I'm keeping my �part of the response on the timing/trade-off topic.
             <br />
             Please let me know if you'd like to talk about this by phone to get our
             <br />
             plans in sync.

             &gt;&gt; a very intelligent and interesting approach to opening things up
             <br />
             &gt;&gt; through this platform, and Patrick (whose e-mail address I don't have)
             <br />
             &gt;&gt; did a great job walking us through and responding to questions -- he
             <br />
             &gt;&gt; is clearly a terrific find and asset to this undertaking.
             <br />
             &gt;&gt;
             <br />
             &gt;&gt; With respect to the key question that you posed at the end of the
             <br />
             conference
             <br />
             <br />
             &gt;&gt; -- just how much control AAAS is seeking -- it is a difficult question
             <br />
             &gt;&gt; to answer until we've actually started working with the
             <br />
             &gt;&gt; implementation, and see
             <br />
             &gt;&gt; what sort of configuration options are available &quot;out of the box,&quot;
             <br />
             &gt;&gt; etc. �So there's a bit of chicken-and-egg here. �But here are some
             <br />
             &gt;&gt; thoughts that may give an idea where we're coming from.
             <br />
             &gt;&gt;
             <br />
             &gt;&gt; I think in many ways the &quot;sweet spot&quot; for our organization would be
             <br />
             &gt;&gt; something that enabled us to take advantage of HighWire's strengths in
             <br />
             &gt;&gt; the organization, delivery, and ancillary processes associated
             <br />
             &gt;&gt; scholarly publishing -- e.g.,
             <font>
              things like access control, processing
              <br />
              &gt;&gt; NLM XML, handling reference linking, keeping usage stats
              <br />
              &gt;&gt; COUNTER-compliant, taking care of metadata delivery to major
              <br />
              &gt;&gt; downstream partners like PubMed and CrossRef, etc.
              <font>
               <br />
               &gt;&gt; -- but that would let us have
               <b>
                <font>
                 substantially more control of how site
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; content is manipulated and displayed on the front end.
                </font>
               </b>
               <font>
                �To us, that
                <br />
                &gt;&gt; suggests a solution that would give us
                <b>
                 <font>
                  substantial control
                 </font>
                </b>
                <font>
                 over
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; building, modifying, and
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; maintaining article, TOC, gateway, and other templates, but that would
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; not involve modifications by us of the core HighWire functions that
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; pertain to content delivery to the site from the Atom store or
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; downstream processes. We
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; would also envision ourselves as tapping the full range of search
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; options that HighWire is developing for this platform, which you
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; described in the meeting.
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt;
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; The sense that I have is that this falls perhaps somewhat short of the
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; approach that the other publisher you've been working with is taking,
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; but that it would still put us very much in the direction in which
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; that&nbsp; publisher
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; has headed. �It is very difficult to say further how far we might want
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; to&nbsp; go without working with the system in a sandbox environment and assessing
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; how i t&nbsp; might actually work in practice. �We're also interested in your
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; thoughts on whether there are ways to start with a certain level of
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; publisher control and
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; increase that over time as the project evolves and our experience with
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; the system grows.
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt;
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; The main things that came up in our subsequent discussion after the
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; call were:
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt;
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; --Drupal versions. �We talked a bit about the fact that the current
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; instance is in Drupal 6, and that we would want to develop in Drupal
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; 7. �I think you guys told us a bit about your plans for that
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; migration, but we would be interested in learning again what you think
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; the timeline is for porting to 7,
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; and in a larger sense how you plan to handle upgrades to the future
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; Drupal releases that are sure to come.
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt;
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; --Signaling. �Obviously, the Signaling project is the &quot;elephant in the
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; room,&quot; both in terms of available resources at HighWire, and in terms
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; of integration. Ideally, we are hoping for as consistent a system
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; across products as we can achieve, and are a bit worried that
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; Signaling, on a separate development track in order to speed its
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; conversion to the H20 platform, may go in directions different to
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; those we'd develop for Science and STM.
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt;
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; I know that Signaling is being built on the Drupal front end partly in order
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; to make things happen as quickly as possible, and that you would
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; probably be
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; understandably reluctant to do anything that would slow that process
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt; down. But one thing
                 <font>
                  my team
                  <font>
                   was wondering was whether it might be
                   <br />
                   &gt;&gt; possible for
                   <font>
                    them to become involved in pieces of that project
                    <font>
                     as it develops, to gain an
                     <br />
                     &gt;&gt; understanding of the approach you're using and possibly help gain
                     <br />
                     &gt;&gt; insights&nbsp; we
                     <br />
                     &gt;&gt; might use in the Science implementation to keep the systems as&nbsp; consistent as
                     <br />
                     &gt;&gt; possible.
                     <br />
                     &gt;&gt;
                     <br />
                     &gt;&gt; -------
                     <br />
                     &gt;&gt;
                     <br />
                     &gt;&gt; I hope that the above provides enough of an idea of where we'd like to
                     <br />
                     &gt;&gt; go that we can take the next step on this, and perhaps set up a
                     <br />
                     &gt;&gt; test/sandbox environment that will let our team at AAAS start to get
                     <br />
                     &gt;&gt; our hands dirty&nbsp; with
                     <br />
                     &gt;&gt; this. �Please let me know your thoughts, and thanks again for an interesting

    What Polly said re Track 1 &amp; content migration. Rich had that project well in hand before his departure.

     John, the content migration has been going on since early 2011, and I believe that we're waiting for final feedback from AAAS on it.&nbsp; This is the so-called &quot;Track 1&quot; migration.&nbsp; Back when I was here in the spring, the notion you'd floated with them was that once Track 1 was complete we'd be able to launch a mobile site with just the original content; I don't know whether that's still the plan though.
     <br />
     <br />
     I forwarded my most-recent notes from June on what you'd told them about the Drupal strategy/commitments.&nbsp; As I wasn't around this summer, I'm sure more happened then.
     <br />
     <br />
     Thx,

      Thanks, Ron, for resurrecting these notes.
      <br />
      <br />
      I'd like to get from Polly (the PM) and Bill (the sponsor for the
      <br />
      migration) any recollection of what we told them about the drupal
      <br />
      strategy and when the work would start. I know that Nancy visited in the
      <br />
      summer (late July I think) to figure out the function issue. But I
      <br />
      wasn't there for that.
      <br />
      <br />
      The issue seems to be when the migration project starts, and what has
      <br />
      been told to the customer about this.
      <br />
      <br />
      Ron says that the new project manager is ready to start the project, but
      <br />
      what parts of the project are and are not ready to start now? For
      <br />
      example, can we start the content migration now and get that cleared
      <br />
      before we start the site UI work in Drupal in ...was it January?
      <br />
      February?...

         Mark,
         <br />
         <br />
         Let me cc Bill in on this, since he's the one who has the
         <br />
         responsibility mantle for stke migration.
         <br />
         <br />
         I think you are saying:
         <br />
         <br />
         Rich has managed the project through the point where we have the
         <br />
         decision to go to a drupal model
         <br />
         The next phase is drupal scoping, which will be managed by ....?
         <br />
         and will take until ....? (perhaps this is managed by someone on the
         <br />
         drupal team, or Todd, and is overseen by Bernie but not managed by
         <br />
         him, to assure a project management transition that follows this
         <br />
         phase)
         <br />
         The phase following scoping will begin on ....? and a new project
         <br />
         manager will be assigned then.
         <br />
         <br />
         If this is correct, then we need to fill in the blanks this week so
         <br />
         we can communicate this to AAAS this week.
         <br />
         <br />
         Bill or I should communicate this.
         <br />

         Hi John,
         <br />
         <br />
         Rich Gierak is leaving HW this week, and to my knowledge this has
         <br />
         not been
         <br />
         communicated to AAAS yet.&nbsp; As the AAAS executive sponsor, how do
         <br />
         you want to go
         <br />
         about the notification process?&nbsp; The problem is we don't have a
         <br />
         replacement for
         <br />
         Rick in the short term.&nbsp; I just spoke to Bernard, and he is working
         <br />
         to find a
         <br />
         replacement, but once hired it will take some time for the new
         <br />
         person to get up to
         <br />
         speed.&nbsp; All the other PjM resources we have are fully (and over)
         <br />
         committed.&nbsp; The
         <br />
         good news is that the &quot;Phase One&quot; content work is well in hand,
         <br />
         thanks to Marisol
         <br />
         and Jen (contract content work).&nbsp; We think the message is that we
         <br />
         can still
         <br />
         continue full speed with the content work, and the preliminary
         <br />
         &quot;Phase Two&quot; aka
         <br />
         drupal scoping can also proceed without a dedicated project
         <br />
         manager.&nbsp; When and how
         <br />
         to communicate this to AAAS?
         <br />
         <br />
         Thanks

     Could happen before August 25.&nbsp; Might happen beforehand. Could happen as soon as Firday.&nbsp; Jen could start content loading as soon as next week.
     <br />
     <br />
     Goal is to have content loaded by end of year. It should finish before schedule, end of december.
     <br />
     <br />
     Site &quot;meetign notes&quot; are big meetings. Weekly meetings are in a separate google doc collection that needs to be loaded.

     - CJ knows more at higher level
     <br />
     - TM and PH up to date on the custom features
     <br />
     - Jen knows content pretty well. She did the science migration, too.

     #1. When schedule is defined, WE STICK TO IT. They can live w/ambiguity for a while.

     Could happen before August 25.&nbsp; Might happen beforehand. Could happen as soon as Firday.&nbsp; Jen could start content loading as soon as next week.
     <br />
     <br />
     Goal is to have content loaded by end of year. It should finish before schedule, end of december.
     <br />
     <br />
     Site &quot;meetign notes&quot; are big meetings. Weekly meetings are in a separate google doc collection that needs to be loaded.

     - Polly; Marisol knows some history and people; mark J = none
     <br />
     - h10 site Jeff P

     - Tina knows - Connections Map
     <br />
     - Sudhanshu has nice feature knowledge, too
     <br />
     - CJ knows more at higher level
     <br />
     - TM and PH up to date on the custom features
     <br />
     - Jen knows content pretty well. She did the science migration, too.
     <br />
     <br />
     PROMISES
     <br />
     #1. When schedule is defined, WE STICK TO IT. They can live w/ambiguity for a while.
     <br />
     so track 1 dates in good shape. (But they have to do their QA)

  TM: JBJS will do the federated search that STKE needs
  <br />
  <br />
  Can't get done this year.
  <br />
  <br />
  - BMJ preview probably in August (late); July;&nbsp; launches later this year
  <br />
  - JBJB late Jan
  <br />
  <br />
  Would not BEGIN STKE until January.
  <br />
  <br />
  PS: non-starter.
  <br />
  <br />
  MC: we need an approach that doesn't make everything serial.
  <br />
  Not going to make the date unless we get original resources.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  GS: we have a lot of file manager pages.&nbsp;&nbsp; These pages include logic.
  <br />
  PH: That's a good outsource option. India.
  <br />
  <br />
  JS: Could we migrate the content first,so we could get a signaling mobile site, which they want. Explore before we present.
  <br />
  PH: Mobile sites talk to site, don't use markup server... yet.
  <br />
  RS:&nbsp; Their *native content*. Vs.
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: Community db (personalities)... white pages
  <br />
  <br />
  JS: Stewart liked the idea of starting from scratch. (Nancy owns the site)
  <br />
  <br />
  JS: B/c we were a year late with the Science launch, they're going to be really sensitive about us showing milestones for all the ongoing progress.
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: We would like JDs who have CSS, JavaScript, PHP; MySQL; Drupal. Anyone will go to the Chapter 3 class.
  <br />
  <br />
  PH: Drupal is a CMS but it's striving to be a complete Web Service.
  <br />
  <br />
  RS: big killer is Connection Map.
  <br />
  <br />
  PS: Track 1 puts regular content into h20 content store.&nbsp; Not connection map data, etc. No fora.
  <br />
  <br />
  RG: Track 1 completes August or so. You could actually aim a site at the
  <br />
  Content conversion starts in late august. Content ready in November.&nbsp; Article content only.
  <br />
  <br />
  PS: review of sample issues begin in June.
  <br />
  <br />
  PS: Forums, etc, are Track 2.
  <br />
  RL : New project plan, with mobile track as soon as content complete
  <br />
  <br />
  Track 1 content; Track 2 mobile;
  <br />
  RS: Mobile can use a vanilla H2O site.
  <br />
  JS: Track 3 search? search results are very slow, b/c of so many corpuses... (?)
  <br />
  TM: THey do 23 search each time, serially. At .2 seconds per search, it's slow.
  <br />
  TM: when A4D goes in, we'll be hitting SASS less. That will speed up ASCO search.
  <br />
  <br />
  PH: There's no parallelization in PHP
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: They need to change their UI if we want to make this go much fast.
  <br />
  <br />
  JS: Parallelization and additional resources.
  <br />
  TM:
  <b>
   <font>
    A test.
   </font>
  </b>
  <font>
   I can put a faceted search in place... in about 2 weeks. Could make it live on their site for them to play with...
   <br />
   <br />
   TM: Rachel can't find people who know the language or the platform.
   <br />
   RS: [nods]
   <br />
   <br />
   TM: Expect high customization for a
   <b>
    <font>
     mobile site.
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    <br />
    <br />
    PS: They don't do a lot of File Manager in STKE. Not like Science.
    <br />
    <br />
    PH: Could have Drupal control all of their File Manager pages while they're still in H10.
    <br />
    [agreed, no a differentiator]
    <br />
    <br />
    RS: Delivery of content via the new API might also be offered early.
    <br />
    <br />
    JS: Mike K is goign to see AAAS this week, and JS and Tom R are visiting later this month.

   <br />
   BMJ: June cum August
   <br />
   JBJS-BR: January (and reuse for STKE of many modules)
   <br />
   barring more resources, would start STKE after JBJS-BR (January)

   John: proposed we migrate their content so they can do a mobile site
   <br />
   do content first, build (&quot;standard&quot;, even?) mobile site on top
   <br />
   something they need that would make them happy
   <br />
   JDs to do Drupal wd have CSS, Javascript and PHP
   <br />
   Track 1 - journal content only (not forums) - samples in June, Production in November
   <br />
   new Track 2?
   <br />
   Mobile? (std mobile site?)
   <br />
   fix Search? (now 23 searches in serial, no display until all complete)

  RG: have all data for Track 2 schedule.&nbsp; We could launch in Jan 2012 if we had all the resources we needed. But it includes 72 days&nbsp; of XSL, or 600 hours of MK or GS team.

  Some for Rachel exclusively.

  RG: I need to reconcile with Polly S re: the hours/.days.

  22 days Rachel

  <br />
  RL :So we need to do the schedule.
  <br />
  RG: can do it very soon.
  <br />
  <br />
  RL: proposal to do it in Drupal rather than XSLT.
  <br />
  AAAS might not be quite signed up enough, not sure.
  <br />
  <br />
  RG: Connection Map is big piece. hard b/c in h2O foundation we don't have capacity to take markup and content as is, and pass to browser.&nbsp; It's largely rendered by AAAS server.
  <br />
  <br />
  Track 1 is getting the content into the atom Store.
  <br />

  RG: Purchased a license for Merlin (alternative to MS Project). Mac only.

  Thanks for taking your valuable time for the meeting yesterday.
  <br />
  Here are the main items discussed during the meeting:
  <br />
  <br />
  1. HW will make the web service call with the doi.
  <br />
  2. AI will return the XML call with 5 doi's.
  <br />
  3. The recommender widget UI box will be dynamic; it will only show if there is something to be shown.
  <br />
  4. Short titles will be displayed in the widget. The height of widget is yet to be determined based on the length of short titles and the displacement this is going to cause to other items of column 2.
  <br />
  5. Recommendations will be sought for content with doi only.
  <br />
  6. Recommendations will be sought for a date range starting with the most recent content and incrementally increasing to about 5 years of past content.
  <br />
  7. AACR and AI will discuss more about the issue of keeping the doi's in sync between HW and AI.
  <br />
  8. HW and AI to discuss the possibility of adding a doi &quot;class&quot; attribute to the XML call between them.
  <br />
  9. The beta demo to be unveiled on 11-15-11.
  <br />
  10. AACR &amp; AI will test the indexed data before the beta demo.
  <br />
  11. The beta demo will include 2 issues of a journal of AACR's choosing, Cancer Research being a good candidate.
  <br />
  12. Phase 2 &amp; 3 will be discussed in the future but the high level thought from AACR at this point for Phase 2 is a recommender service on collections that have been indexed with taxonomy. It will only involve content at HW.
  <br />
  <br />
  The next thing to follow is the quote from HW to AACR for Phase 1. On agreement, HW will work on building the web service and prepare the demo.
  <br />
  <br />
  Please let me know if there are any questions.

  Hello Dharm,
  <br />
  <br />
  So sorry this is taking a while to put together.�� With respect to (i), are you really just after the estimate of actual placement of the widget in col 2, or do you need an estimate of the service to provide the real content for Recommender Widget?�� (the real effort being tied up in the second part of this) --- Sara has gone for the day, but I'm going to guess not more than a day to put the widget framework in place.� Again, this is not an estimate of really providing the content for the widget.
  <br />
  <br />
  I spoke to John Haggerty with respect to the Web Services. � I think he/Rachel will be the technical point folks for this effort. � I'll speak to Rachel about this tomorrow, in my 10am mtg with her, but she will probably need to be involved, hopefully with John doing more of the work, and playing a bigger role.
  <br />
  <br />
  A couple of points about the service as is written below:
  <br />
  <br />
  - We may not have short title info for most publishers -- perhaps these recommendations are all coming within AACR, and we do have all content with short titles, so that is not a problem -
  <br />
  - With respect to #5 below -- I am not sure there will always be the same view available in recommended resources coming back from Access Inovations - do we know that for sure?� Do we need to have a business rule that says we will resolve to the shortest or longest accessible view available?�
  <br />
  <br />
  If this is not what you need for your call with AACR tomorrow, let me know and we will follow up fairly quickly.
  <br />
  <br />
  Margo

  Hi Margie,
  <br />
  <br />
  In discussing this internally here at HighWire, the scenario you described of the Data Harmony &quot;Recommender&quot; web service probably makes the most sense initially, given AACR's Phase 1 requirements.&nbsp; To help you size the demand on your servers to support this, we did a quick count of content views in all of the AACR websites where the list of recommended &quot;More like this&quot; articles would appear.&nbsp; You would be getting a call from HW every time a user views an abstract or a full-text HTML page.
  <font>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; For your calculations, figure on somewhere between 2.2 million and 2.5 million calls per month.
   <font>
    <br />
    <br />
    Let us know if that helps with your planning.
    <br />
    <br />
    Best regards,
    <br />
    <br />
    Bert
    <br />

    &gt; Subject: Re: Recommender - Re: Updating the options for Highwire - AACR Case Study
    <br />
    &gt;
    <br />
    &gt; Wow, interesting feedback on the search!
    <br />
    &gt;
    <br />
    &gt; We already provide a web service which can do the indexing of the articles for
    <br />
    &gt; deposit.&nbsp; We can just keep that indexing and match it with the return call.
    <br />
    &gt;
    <br />
    <font>
     &gt; We would like to implement this as a web service which would be called and provide
     <br />
     &gt; the &quot;more like these&quot; on the article page.&nbsp; The Web service which (when called from a
     <br />
     &gt; specific document) provide a list of &quot;more like this&quot; documents.
     <font>
      <br />
      &gt;
      <br />
      &gt; One way for it to work is as follows :
      <br />
      &gt; We provide two Web services, one for indexing (Data Harmony MAI on the AACR side),
      <br />
      &gt; the other for searching and providing &quot;more like this&quot; documents. (Data Harmony
      <br />
      &gt; Recommender)
      <br />
      &gt;
      <br />
      &gt; 1- Web service A is called by the AACR system to submit a document content.
      <br />
      &gt; 2- MAI system will index the document, save the indexing to the document repository,
      <br />
      &gt; it can also send the document path and indexing to the DH Recommender.
      <br />
      &gt; 3- A search system surfaces a requested document and sends it to Highwire to serve
      <br />
      &gt; the document
      <br />
      &gt; 4. The DH Recommender looks at that document indexing and provides &quot;more like this&quot;
      <br />
      &gt; resultant based on the documents indexing set.
      <br />
      &gt; 5. The DH Recommender presents a list of the appropriate similar items within the
      <br />
      &gt; Highwire AACR.
      <br />
      &gt;
      <br />
      &gt; The web service is configurable by Highwire.
      <br />
      &gt;
      <br />
      &gt; Or something along those lines
      <br />

      &gt;&gt; Margie,
      <br />
      &gt;&gt;
      <br />
      &gt;&gt; Thanks for the reply.
      <br />
      &gt;&gt;
      <br />
      &gt;&gt; Based on our extensive researcher interviews, journal-site-search is
      <br />
      &gt;&gt; not an important use case.&nbsp; Searching is done in Google, Google
      <br />
      &gt;&gt; Scholar, Web of Science, and Pubmed; people have already located an
      <br />
      &gt;&gt; item before they get to the journal site (and they go right to the
      <br />
      &gt;&gt; article from the search engine)
      <br />
      &gt;&gt;
      <br />
      &gt;&gt; So in terms of value, I'd say making recommendations on the article
      <br />
      &gt;&gt; page is the most likely place to find an ROI.&nbsp; Or at least that is
      <br />
      &gt;&gt; the place to start.
      <br />
      &gt;&gt;
      <br />
      &gt;&gt; So it sounds like a key factor is where is the repository of all
      <br />
      &gt;&gt; terms for all documents located?&nbsp; And that is the place where The
      <br />
      &gt;&gt; Recommender has to point to.&nbsp; If you are repository agnostic, can
      <br />
      &gt;&gt; you build The Recommender to point at any repository that can
      <br />
      &gt;&gt; support the interfaces needed?
      <br />
      &gt;&gt;
      <br />
      &gt;&gt; From the HighWire point of view
      <font>
       , I'd like to see a Recommender
       <br />
       &gt;&gt; widget that is produced by AI and configured by HighWire (or
       <br />
       &gt;&gt; AACR).
       <font>
        &nbsp; That's what we did with BayNote for two major clients, and
        <br />
        &gt;&gt; it worked well.
        <br />

        &gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks John,&nbsp; Let me see if I can talk this over with Helen in the next
        <br />
        &gt;&gt;&gt; couple of days.&nbsp; The key is whether there is a single repository in which
        <br />
        &gt;&gt;&gt; case there would need to be an export from Highwire to that repository
        <br />
        &gt;&gt;&gt; for search although the documents severed could still be resident and
        <br />
        &gt;&gt;&gt; called from the Highwire servers for display and rights managements
        <br />
        &gt;&gt;&gt;
        <br />
        &gt;&gt;&gt; or whether the search is federated over a couple or more repositories.
        <br />
        &gt;&gt;&gt;
        <br />
        &gt;&gt;&gt; The the recommender we are dependant on having access to the taxonomy
        <br />
        &gt;&gt;&gt; terms applied to the individual documents.&nbsp; We are repository agnostic.

        &gt;&gt;&gt;

         &gt;&gt;&gt; the individual document.&nbsp; Faster processing time and higher precision.

          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi John (et. al.),
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am going to assume that the data structure governed by the
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DTD.&nbsp; That way we will
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not get messed up with mapping fields and data from one structure
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to another.&nbsp; We
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; operate natively in XML and so it is the DTD / Schema which governs
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how we handle
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; data inhouse.&nbsp; There is a LOT I do not know about how Highwire
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; works so I need to
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keep this pretty conceptual until I know more about your system.
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bill will be responsible for this area.&nbsp; Data flows into the system
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are in his domain.&nbsp; He and you and Helen will work out the tagging
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the dataflows.
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think we need to ask AACR (Helen Atkins) exactly how she sees the
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recommender
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; working but the attached slides might help with that
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understanding.&nbsp; It is true the
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Journals hosted on the Highwire platform are part but not all of
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the offering AACR
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has for their membership.
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We have asked Helen to write a Product Requirements Document for the
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Recommender. Somewhat similar I suspect to your slide 5, but a
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; widget or a set of widgets.
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, that is the visual manifestation of the Recommender.
          <font>
           Its
           <br />
           &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; backend services are something we will all need to figure out from the
           <br />
           &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PRD.
           <font>
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Several options occur to me:
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A. First we need to decide how search will work for them:
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. A&nbsp; distributed search from a single interface.&nbsp; I am not calling
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this federated
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because I don't know that it truly is.&nbsp; In this case I think the
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; searcher on the
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AACR site would launch a search query in a window.&nbsp; The search
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be done on
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; both Highwire and the rest of the documents bringing back a result
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; set from each
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; repository - journals from Highwire and other (proceedings, books,
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; etc.) to present
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the user.&nbsp; In this case the recommender will use the taxonomy
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; terms introduced
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the search as keywords and bring back all relevant content
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; posted by source type
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; into separate windows for the user.&nbsp; That is conference papers,
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; awards, grants,
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upcoming meetings etc - as in slide four of the attached PPT.&nbsp;&nbsp; So
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a single query
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; searches several places and returns the results in several windows
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the web site.
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you implement such distributed search systems now (it does sound
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like federated search to me, but as you say, it doesn't have to be
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if somebody has the repository of all documents)?&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, if
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Helen puts this in the PRD, can you do this?
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While federated search is in our product roadmap, it is out ahead of
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the projects we are scheduling now.&nbsp; So this would need to be done
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by AI if it is for the short term. Out in 2012 we can look at it,
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; though I don't understand your description, &quot; the recommender will
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use the taxonomy terms introduced
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the search as keywords &quot;&nbsp; but I don't think I need to understand
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that now.
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Highwire convinces AACR to put all its materials into the
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Highwire search , not
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just the Journals. Then a single search is launched and material
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; returned from a
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; single directed query
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this is either a) federated search as described above, or b)
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HighWire loads all AACR content.&nbsp; I am pretty sure (b) is not what AACR
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wants.
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. A recommender based on the AACR thesaurus could suggest
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; additional related and
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; narrower terms for the user to follow the search.&nbsp; Please see slide 9
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the attached
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So in this case the Recommender is a web service you provide that we
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and others who build sites can call?&nbsp; Not sure I follow how slide 9
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is related.&nbsp; It is showing &quot;people who liked ... also liked ...&quot;,
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which is different from &quot;more like this&quot; to me.&nbsp; The former is not
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; based on taxonomy but user co-occurrence frequency, isn't it?
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; B. Once the user has selected items of interest the Recommender
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; comes into play.
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Without a user selection it is hard to know exactly what they
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wanted.&nbsp; So the &quot;More
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like these&quot; or &quot;People who liked this also liked that&quot; does not
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happen easily with
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out a selection.&nbsp; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In our case the easiest way to make that selection is to choose
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; another item with
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exactly the same index terms as the one the user selected.&nbsp; Once
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could assume that
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exactly the same indexing would give a very good recommendation to
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the user.&nbsp; When
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there is no 100% match we go to the next highest level of matches.&nbsp; We
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would suggest matching on all the repositories.&nbsp; In that case it
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; depends on how the resulting sets are displayed.&nbsp; It becomes limited by
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the web page&nbsp; options in 3 A1.
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is not as hard to visualize in number A2.
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So all this suggests that you would build the back end services for
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Recommender, and those of us who need to display recommendations
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (HW or other AACR web sites) would call your back end services
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; presumably via a webservice to generate a widget, etc..&nbsp; Is that
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correct?&nbsp; If so, do you have anything that defines the services we can
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; call?
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If not, I don't think we've addressed the key issue I'm raising:
            <br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            <font>
             where is the repository of tagging
             <font>
              that allows cross-document-type
              <br />
              &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recommendations, and what services does that repository offer those
              <br />
              &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of us who are consumers of the services?
              <br />
              &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
              <br />
              &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks!
              <br />

              <br />
              &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to this project, and then more details can be designed.)

              <br />
              &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; directs our infrastructure engineering) also.

              <br />
              &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bill should decide the answers here.&nbsp; I suspect we will want the terms

              &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in a separate file with an ID.&nbsp; But up to Bill.

              <br />
              &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
              <br />
              &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've got a conceptual problem here.&nbsp; Presumably AACR wants
              <br />
              &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recommendations eventually to include
              <font>
               more than just Highwire-hosted
               <br />
               &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; documents.&nbsp; If&nbsp; that is so, I
               <font>
                <br />
                &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would think the Recommender needs to be a service associated with
                <br />
                &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the repository
                <br />
                &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; host.&nbsp; Do you see this differently?
                <font>
                 &nbsp; (My understanding from another
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; email is that
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AACR is going to host the repository since all the documents are
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AACR documents.
                 <br />
                 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is that correct?)
                 <font>
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you supply the recommender to us (i.e., if my understanding that we
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are recommending more than HighWire-hosted documents is incorrect), how
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would you do
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that?&nbsp; Would you be sending us code that assumes some data structure?
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WHAT ELSE?

                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear John and Tom,
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Much is going on with the AIP announcement and movements to
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; SilverChair.&nbsp; I also
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know your user group meeting is coming in September.
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We have two customers, AACR and SMPTE who have data ready to move
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; forward on the
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Highwire Platform. The third, Sage Publishing is nearly
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there.&nbsp; Let's use AACR as
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an early use case.
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; GETTING AACR TEST DATA TO HIGHWIRE
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In the long term, they will be adding the taxonomy terms early in
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their process and
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; send the data through EJ Press and on to Highwire and Aptara as
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; well as their web
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; site. To get started we need a different path
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We can supply content to Highwire as soon as you are ready to
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; receive it. we can
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; either send a full record including the taxonomy terms or just the
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; article ID and
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Taxonomy terms for that article.&nbsp; which do you prefer?&nbsp; You can
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then match the data
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; internally.&nbsp; Another option is to rerun the data adding the
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taxonomy terms in the
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;KWD&gt; element and returning the data to you.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a technical
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suggestion on the
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; content which I will send separately since I want to stay on a
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little higher level
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in this email.
                  <br />

                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; THE RECOMMENDER
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are many ways to do recommendations on additional articles
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most of them are
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wither 1). vector / statistical / Bayesian or 2). user profile history
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; based. There is a third option.&nbsp; If the data has been tagged with
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taxonomy&nbsp; terms then the
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more closely the indexing matches, the more likely the recommended
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; articles will
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; satisfy the user.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is if articles get 5 index terms each
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from the taxonomy
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attached to them and if the search likes one of the articles then
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; another article
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which has the same five index terms will most likely also answer
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their needs.&nbsp; This
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is a less system intensive and more precise way to produce relevant
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; results to the
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; searcher.&nbsp; We can supply this to you. Both the taxonomy term tagging
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the software code to make the Recommender work on the Highwire
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; platform.
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know that AACR wants to have a Recommender as their main use case in
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the integration of their content.
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WHAT ELSE CAN HIGHWIRE DO?
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are a lot of other features Highwire could quickly implement
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for publishers.
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The back side requires that the data be further enriched with
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taxonomy terms and
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perhaps other controlled metadata data as well such as article
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; type, broad topics
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or categories, location (geographic) or author enrichments (including
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the directions Collexis / UniPHY was taking).&nbsp; we have the tools to do
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; much of this
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; automatically which means your customers can quickly come up to speed
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the platform and that you will have leading edge options to offer.
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On the user interface side this translates to a significantly enhanced
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; user experience. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery has recently
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; launched a new platform http://www.jbjs.org&nbsp; it is nice but it is not
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as advanced&nbsp; as it could
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be.&nbsp; If the taxonomy was fully implemented then in addition to the data
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; range searching, board topics and keywords, the platform could serve
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the&nbsp; user the Related
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Terms to broaden their search, the Narrower Terms to pin point it.&nbsp; We
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could provide auto completion of words as the user types in the search
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; box to insure full
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; coverage. We can show the the full browse-able hierarchy of the
                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taxonomy to view

                  <br />
                  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I firmly believe we can move immediately to take the AACR files to full

  Bert C, DS
  <br />
  <br />
  Demo'ed interface with recommender engine. It's based on how good the&nbsp; topic matching is.
  <br />
  <br />
  Bert: AACR hosting repository, I think it has to do with external data sources.
  <br />
  I think AI will want to host this
  <br />
  Thoughtput is much higher than admin interface.
  <br />
  <font>
   <br />
   <br />
   QUESTIONS:
   <br />
   1. How would AI web service provide us a link to the resources? DOI? that's OK for HW articles. We'll at least eventually have resources that don't have DOI.
   <br />
   <br />
   2. what do we pass to the web service ? a resource ID?
   <font>
    <br />
    <font>
     <br />
     WHERE DOES THE BACK END RESIDE?
     <br />
     3. if AI hosts it, phase 1 is easy
     <br />
     4. if AI hosts it,&nbsp; collection browsing, or mini-sites, might be harder if HW doesn't host the dat.
     <font>
      <br />
      5. Do we start with external service, and the internalize it for a Drupal minisite, while still relying on AI for servicing *external* data.
      <br />
      <br />
      For an example AI customer

      I told Helen I wanted them to use NLM Subject
      <br />
      We use it for Subject COllections. We can do numbers, or controlled vocab names.
      <br />
      We'd recommend ranged values.
      <br />
      <br />
      Lucene is related to SOLR.

  BW manages our content system. use cases, work flows. If it involves tags in the content, he's got to get them parsed, loaded, etc.
  <br />
  <br />
  Met with AACR on May 19th.
  <br />
  Don't really want mini-site, they want the recommendation engine. So we're working on
  <br />
  1. getting definition from AACR what recommendation means. They've been asked for PRD.&nbsp; [JS will ask for&nbsp; PRD from HA this coming week]
  <br />
  <br />
  2. IN parallel we're trying to work out data flows.
  <br />
  BW: two data flows: back content; online. The latter starts with MSS, and then it's carried along.&nbsp;
  <b>
   <font>
    Tags can come in the source XML, or a peripheral file.
   </font>
  </b>
  <font>
   <br />
   Backfile will be peripheral file, typically one file per issue.
   <br />
   <br />
   Typically, AI has taxonomy -
   <font>
    1400 terms, 6 levels.
    <font>
     That's too many too much for UI.&nbsp; Either we or Ai will have to roll them up.
     <br />
     <br />
     BC: Maybe we want AI to get their recommender to work in Drupal.
     <br />
     AACR has lots of *diverse* content, beyond HW, they want the recommender to work for. Lots of this can't work semantically.&nbsp; AI's is machine-aided indexing. So journal articles could be very quickly tagged. But the short list of conference, awards, etc, could be done manually via the same tools.
     <br />
     <br />
     JS: they want this on their (H2O) journal sites.
     <br />
     BH: widget, or web service
     <br />
     JS: margie hlava said we could write the widget..&nbsp; Web service would be best. We don't hold all the data of interest for AACR, so we shouldn't write and implement the algorithm.
     <br />
     <br />
     BC: they have a quasi SaaS model, but pointing at internal customers, not end user.&nbsp; I can't see them making the investment to provide a public-facing service.
     <br />
     <br />
     JS: workflow and dataflow around maintaining a service we host scares me. I'm not worried about the data store, for indexing data we don't maintain.
     <br />
     <br />
     JS: there are other AI-like vendors.&nbsp; Temis, Silverchair
     <br />
     <br />
     JS: lots of ambiguities. Need requirements. What are Data flows (BW).&nbsp; What is the back end, and who runs them (HW/AI). And who pays for what.

  Subject: Re: Recommender - Re: Updating the options for Highwire - AACR Case Study
  <br />
  <br />
  Wow, interesting feedback on the search!
  <br />
  <br />
  We already provide a web service which can do the indexing of the articles for
  <br />
  deposit.&nbsp; We can just keep that indexing and match it with the return call.
  <br />
  <br />
  We would like to implement this as a web service which would be called and provide the &quot;more like these&quot; on the article page.&nbsp; The Web service which (when called from a specific document) provide a list of &quot;more like this&quot; documents.
  <br />
  <br />
  One way for it to work is as follows : We provide two Web services, one for indexing (Data Harmony MAI on the AACR side), the other for searching and providing &quot;more like this&quot; documents. (Data Harmony Recommender)
  <br />
  <br />
  1- Web service A is called by the AACR system to submit a document content.
  <br />
  2- MAI system will index the document, save the indexing to the document repository, it can also send the document path and indexing to the DH Recommender.
  <br />
  3- A search system surfaces a requested document and sends it to Highwire to serve the document
  <br />
  4. The DH Recommender looks at that document indexing and provides &quot;more like this&quot; resultant based on the documents indexing set.
  <br />
  5. The DH Recommender presents a list of the appropriate similar items within the Highwire AACR.
  <br />
  <br />
  The web service is configurable by Highwire.
  <br />
  <br />
  Or something along those lines

  &gt; Margie,
  <br />
  &gt;
  <br />
  &gt; Thanks for the reply.
  <br />
  &gt;
  <br />
  &gt; Based on our extensive researcher interviews, journal-site-search is
  <br />
  &gt; not an important use case.&nbsp; Searching is done in Google, Google
  <br />
  &gt; Scholar, Web of Science, and Pubmed; people have already located an
  <br />
  &gt; item before they get to the journal site (and they go right to the
  <br />
  &gt; article from the search engine)
  <br />
  &gt;
  <br />
  &gt; So in terms of value, I'd say making recommendations on the article
  <br />
  &gt; page is the most likely place to find an ROI.&nbsp; Or at least that is
  <br />
  &gt; the place to start.
  <br />
  &gt;
  <br />
  &gt; So it sounds like a key factor is where is the repository of all
  <br />
  &gt; terms for all documents located?&nbsp; And that is the place where The
  <br />
  &gt; Recommender has to point to.&nbsp; If you are repository agnostic, can
  <br />
  &gt; you build The Recommender to point at any repository that can
  <br />
  &gt; support the interfaces needed?
  <br />
  &gt;
  <br />
  &gt; From the HighWire point of view, I'd like to see a Recommender
  <br />
  &gt; widget that is produced by AI and configured by HighWire (or
  <br />
  &gt; AACR).&nbsp; That's what we did with BayNote for two major clients, and
  <br />
  &gt; it worked well.

  &gt;&gt; Thanks John,&nbsp; Let me see if I can talk this over with Helen in the next
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; couple of days.&nbsp; The key is whether there is a single repository in which
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; case there would need to be an export from Highwire to that repository
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; for search although the documents severed could still be resident and
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; called from the Highwire servers for display and rights managements
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; or whether the search is federated over a couple or more repositories.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; The the recommender we are dependant on having access to the taxonomy
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; terms applied to the individual documents.&nbsp; We are repository agnostic.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not using co-occurrence but rather the keywords associated with
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; the individual document.&nbsp; Faster processing time and higher precision.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;

  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi John (et. al.),
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am going to assume that the data structure governed by the
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DTD.&nbsp; That way we will
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not get messed up with mapping fields and data from one structure
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to another.&nbsp; We
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; operate natively in XML and so it is the DTD / Schema which governs
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how we handle
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; data inhouse.&nbsp; There is a LOT I do not know about how Highwire
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; works so I need to
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keep this pretty conceptual until I know more about your system.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; Bill will be responsible for this area.&nbsp; Data flows into the system
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; are in his domain.&nbsp; He and you and Helen will work out the tagging
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; and the dataflows.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think we need to ask AACR (Helen Atkins) exactly how she sees the
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recommender
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; working but the attached slides might help with that
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understanding.&nbsp; It is true the
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Journals hosted on the Highwire platform are part but not all of
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the offering AACR
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has for their membership.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; We have asked Helen to write a Product Requirements Document for the
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; Recommender. Somewhat similar I suspect to your slide 5, but a
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; widget or a set of widgets.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; However, that is the visual manifestation of the Recommender.&nbsp; Its
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; backend services are something we will all need to figure out from the
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; PRD.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Several options occur to me:
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A. First we need to decide how search will work for them:
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. A&nbsp; distributed search from a single interface.&nbsp; I am not calling
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this federated
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because I don't know that it truly is.&nbsp; In this case I think the
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; searcher on the
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AACR site would launch a search query in a window.&nbsp; The search
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be done on
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; both Highwire and the rest of the documents bringing back a result
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; set from each
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; repository - journals from Highwire and other (proceedings, books,
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; etc.) to present
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the user.&nbsp; In this case the recommender will use the taxonomy
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; terms introduced
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the search as keywords and bring back all relevant content
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; posted by source type
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; into separate windows for the user.&nbsp; That is conference papers,
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; awards, grants,
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upcoming meetings etc - as in slide four of the attached PPT.&nbsp;&nbsp; So
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a single query
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; searches several places and returns the results in several windows
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the web site.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; Do you implement such distributed search systems now (it does sound
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; like federated search to me, but as you say, it doesn't have to be
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; if somebody has the repository of all documents)?&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, if
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; Helen puts this in the PRD, can you do this?
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; While federated search is in our product roadmap, it is out ahead of
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; the projects we are scheduling now.&nbsp; So this would need to be done
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; by AI if it is for the short term. Out in 2012 we can look at it,
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; though I don't understand your description, &quot; the recommender will
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; use the taxonomy terms introduced
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the search as keywords &quot;&nbsp; but I don't think I need to understand
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that now.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Highwire convinces AACR to put all its materials into the
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Highwire search , not
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just the Journals. Then a single search is launched and material
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; returned from a
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; single directed query
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; I think this is either a) federated search as described above, or b)
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; HighWire loads all AACR content.&nbsp; I am pretty sure (b) is not what AACR
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; wants.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. A recommender based on the AACR thesaurus could suggest
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; additional related and
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; narrower terms for the user to follow the search.&nbsp; Please see slide 9
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the attached
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; So in this case the Recommender is a web service you provide that we
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; and others who build sites can call?&nbsp; Not sure I follow how slide 9
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; is related.&nbsp; It is showing &quot;people who liked ... also liked ...&quot;,
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; which is different from &quot;more like this&quot; to me.&nbsp; The former is not
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; based on taxonomy but user co-occurrence frequency, isn't it?
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; B. Once the user has selected items of interest the Recommender
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; comes into play.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Without a user selection it is hard to know exactly what they
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wanted.&nbsp; So the &quot;More
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like these&quot; or &quot;People who liked this also liked that&quot; does not
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happen easily with
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out a selection.&nbsp; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In our case the easiest way to make that selection is to choose
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; another item with
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exactly the same index terms as the one the user selected.&nbsp; Once
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could assume that
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exactly the same indexing would give a very good recommendation to
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the user.&nbsp; When
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there is no 100% match we go to the next highest level of matches.&nbsp; We
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would suggest matching on all the repositories.&nbsp; In that case it
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; depends on how the resulting sets are displayed.&nbsp; It becomes limited by
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the web page&nbsp; options in 3 A1.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is not as hard to visualize in number A2.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; So all this suggests that you would build the back end services for
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; the Recommender, and those of us who need to display recommendations
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; (HW or other AACR web sites) would call your back end services
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; presumably via a webservice to generate a widget, etc..&nbsp; Is that
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; correct?&nbsp; If so, do you have anything that defines the services we can
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; call?
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; If not, I don't think we've addressed the key issue I'm raising:
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; where is the repository of tagging that allows cross-document-type
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; recommendations, and what services does that repository offer those
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; of us who are consumers of the services?
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks!

  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; RECOMMENDER
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've got a conceptual problem here.&nbsp; Presumably AACR wants
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recommendations eventually to include more than just Highwire-hosted
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; documents.&nbsp; If&nbsp; that is so, I
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would think the Recommender needs to be a service associated with
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the repository
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; host.&nbsp; Do you see this differently?&nbsp; (My understanding from another
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; email is that
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AACR is going to host the repository since all the documents are
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AACR documents.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is that correct?)
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you supply the recommender to us (i.e., if my understanding that we
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are recommending more than HighWire-hosted documents is incorrect), how
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would you do
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that?&nbsp; Would you be sending us code that assumes some data structure?
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WHAT ELSE?
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Glad to talk more about these other directions!

  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear John and Tom,
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Much is going on with the AIP announcement and movements to
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; SilverChair.&nbsp; I also
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know your user group meeting is coming in September.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We have two customers, AACR and SMPTE who have data ready to move
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; forward on the
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Highwire Platform. The third, Sage Publishing is nearly
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there.&nbsp; Let's use AACR as
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an early use case.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; GETTING AACR TEST DATA TO HIGHWIRE
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In the long term, they will be adding the taxonomy terms early in
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their process and
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; send the data through EJ Press and on to Highwire and Aptara as
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; well as their web
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; site. To get started we need a different path
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We can supply content to Highwire as soon as you are ready to
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; receive it. we can
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; either send a full record including the taxonomy terms or just the
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; article ID and
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Taxonomy terms for that article.&nbsp; which do you prefer?&nbsp; You can
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then match the data
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; internally.&nbsp; Another option is to rerun the data adding the
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taxonomy terms in the
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;KWD&gt; element and returning the data to you.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a technical
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suggestion on the
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; content which I will send separately since I want to stay on a
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little higher level
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in this email.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; THE RECOMMENDER
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are many ways to do recommendations on additional articles
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most of them are
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wither 1). vector / statistical / Bayesian or 2). user profile history
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; based. There is a third option.&nbsp; If the data has been tagged with
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taxonomy&nbsp; terms then the
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more closely the indexing matches, the more likely the recommended
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; articles will
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; satisfy the user.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is if articles get 5 index terms each
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from the taxonomy
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attached to them and if the search likes one of the articles then
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; another article
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which has the same five index terms will most likely also answer
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their needs.&nbsp; This
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is a less system intensive and more precise way to produce relevant
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; results to the
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; searcher.&nbsp; We can supply this to you. Both the taxonomy term tagging
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the software code to make the Recommender work on the Highwire
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; platform.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know that AACR wants to have a Recommender as their main use case in
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the integration of their content.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WHAT ELSE CAN HIGHWIRE DO?
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are a lot of other features Highwire could quickly implement
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for publishers.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The back side requires that the data be further enriched with
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taxonomy terms and
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perhaps other controlled metadata data as well such as article
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; type, broad topics
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or categories, location (geographic) or author enrichments (including
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the directions Collexis / UniPHY was taking).&nbsp; we have the tools to do
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; much of this
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; automatically which means your customers can quickly come up to speed
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the platform and that you will have leading edge options to offer.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On the user interface side this translates to a significantly enhanced
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; user experience. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery has recently
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; launched a new platform http://www.jbjs.org&nbsp; it is nice but it is not
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as advanced&nbsp; as it could
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be.&nbsp; If the taxonomy was fully implemented then in addition to the data
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; range searching, board topics and keywords, the platform could serve
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the&nbsp; user the Related
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Terms to broaden their search, the Narrower Terms to pin point it.&nbsp; We
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could provide auto completion of words as the user types in the search
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; box to insure full
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; coverage. We can show the the full browse-able hierarchy of the
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taxonomy to view
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; enjoying both the serendipity of&nbsp; discovery in a classified library
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stack and representation of the full breadth of the collection at a
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glance.&nbsp;&nbsp; A sample can be
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; found at www.mediasleuth.com. This implementation uses the Data
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Harmony Search
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Harmony presentation layer software which currently runs on systems
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such as SQL,
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lucene and Perfect Search.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a great deal more and I know that Bert Carelli can give
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you an over view
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of semantic enrichment and how Highwire can implement quickly
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I firmly believe we can move immediately to take the AACR files to full
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; implementation and a use case to proudly display cutting edge
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; semantic technology
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; implementation by your September meeting.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The taxonomy exists
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The rule base exists
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The data is in XML
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The client is willing
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The software exists
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We need to put it together.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shall we??&nbsp; When would you like to talk?

  Subject: AACR Journal Site Projects and Taxonomy Projects
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Because we have some overlap in communication about AACR�s journal sites activities
  <br />
  and the taxonomy project, I would like to ask that both Mike and Helen receive copies
  <br />
  on all correspondence from HighWire and both be invited to participate in the
  <br />
  regularly scheduled conference calls.&nbsp; Mike is the lead for the journals sites and
  <br />
  Helen is the lead on the taxonomy.&nbsp; Rather than put Mike or Helen in the position of
  <br />
  having to discuss something that is not one of his or her&nbsp; major areas of focus that
  <br />
  could result of miscommunication, it is just easier if they are both engaged for now.
  <br />
  As work on the new initiative for the taxonomy nears completion, we can then move the
  <br />
  communication back to Mike so that he is the main point of contact.&nbsp; Similarly, I am
  <br />
  asking Mike and Helen to copy each other on correspondence with HighWire.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  If there are other ideas that would help us communicate better with you, please let
  <br />
  us know.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Best,
  <br />

   Bill and I had a conversation with Helen Atkins of AACR today to clarify things like data flows and tagging for their semantics application.
   <br />
   <br />
   One of the things that Helen clarified for us is that AACR is
   <b>
    <font>
     not particularly interested in a minisite
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    for their November meeting, unless that site could demonstrate the capabilities of the taxonomy.&nbsp; So, we agreed that, since focusing on a minisite would distract us from the work on the taxonomy, that we would just table that idea.
    <br />
    <br />
    It sounded like, to AACR, the minisite had been a HighWire suggestion and not an AACR goal.
    <br />
    <br />
    So
    <b>
     <font>
      Helen is going to write up a PRD
     </font>
    </b>
    <font>
     to describe the Recommender that they want.
     <font>
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      <br />
      MJ:
      <font>
       Elisabeth and Bert

         </font>
        </b>
        <font>
         going to work on AACR with Cathy leaving.&nbsp; The intention was specifically to have Bert involved in the
         <b>
          <font>
           semantic project
          </font>
         </b>
         <font>
          , and ETB as the lead PbM.
          <br />
          <br />
          JS:&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, I can
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt; start with Helen/AACR, and Niz or Mark or Bill (there is both software
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt; and content involved; as well, I assume, as drupal since there is a
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;&gt; minisite involved) can pick it up with Margie.

  Cathy and I spoke briefly about the migration of the AACR umbrella on Tuesday.�� AACR is really looking at this project as a project, not a migration, in that they have a new design and added features.�� I've just added this to the master rollout schedule, currently as a placeholder, so that we have visibility to the work effort along with other migrations -- even though we are taking on a project here.�� It will be handled by the migration/launch team staff.� This is AACR's top project to focus on, once they get beyond the next issue of Cancer Discovery.�� (mid July) -� I will arrange a discussion with Jes and Cathy to firm up the agreed upon scope and potential timing.
  <br />
  <br />
  Xenia has added the two VJ journals, CPC, and CRO to the master rollout schedule as placeholders.

   John, I think you're right that it needs a PjM. Looping in Bernie, in his team leadership role vetting project in need of PjMs and PjMs with availability.
   <br />
   <br />
   Bernie, see John's note below re reasons for PjM need. And Cathy's note re AACR and the project.

     FYI, Mark is proposing:
     <font>
      &quot;Yes, I think I've got something for the infrastructure list.&nbsp; But,
      <b>
       <font>
        we've got to stop w/the emails on this kind of stuff
       </font>
      </b>
      <font>
       and have the PbMs? make an entry in QB, complete w/the explanation of what and when... Can we have the PbM do that for this?
       <br />
       <br />
       If I recall there are a couple of deliverables/requests:
       <br />
       First there's the minisite they want developed by their 11/12 &quot;big event&quot;.
       <br />
       Secondly there is the need to define a spec on how we will interact w/the tagging metadata repository. This spec should &quot;try&quot; to remain consistent between the various partners (e.g. Temis, AI, etc.).&nbsp; For any/all of our customers we need to understand/publish how we're going to store/present/access the metadata created by AI/others...
       <br />
       If the PbM could enter this in QB, ensuring the &quot;Infrastructure&quot; tag is set (new, ask Polly) along w/some use case examples, that would be great!&nbsp; Is that reasonable?&quot;

           I think this needs a project manager assigned, and that is based on:
           <br />
           &gt;
           <br />
           - this is new types of work, rather than assembling what we've done before
           <br />
           - it involves working with a third party (Access Innovation)
           <br />
           - the account manager is not onsite at HW
           <br />
           - there is a deadline that matters to the customer
           <br />
           &gt;
           <br />
           The only thing I can't say is that this is an at risk customer.&nbsp; They aren't! (yet!).
           <br />
           &gt;
           <br />
           So do we make sure that project management time is included in the price for this project so we can add management resource to it?&nbsp; Or is there a better approach you'd recommend?

            Kathy,
            <br />
            I think this will eventually go to WARP, so I'd suggest someone like Ron or someone he designates be included in on this meeting.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm going to copy Anh in on this, since it is related to a
            <b>
             <font>
              product that has been prioritized
             </font>
            </b>
            <font>
             (just yesterday) for
             <b>
              <font>
               recommendation services.
              </font>
             </b>
             <font>
              <br />
              <br />
              I'm going to copy Todd in on this, since it mentions a
              <b>
               <font>
                minisite
               </font>
              </b>
              <font>
               (s?).
               <br />
               <br />
               I think a project manager is needed for this project.&nbsp; It has enough moving parts that it needs coordination.
               <br />
               <br />
               I also wonder if you could check with Louise (or Margo) about how we are doing this for OUP.&nbsp; OUP ran
               <b>
                <font>
                 a &quot;recommendation service bake-off&quot;,
                </font>
               </b>
               <font>
                which involved them installing four widgets (from alternative services) in several of their journals.&nbsp; I think we should find out how we supported that (I don't think we wrote the widgets, and we may have just made it possible for OUP to have a call out to the widgets they were getting from their vendors.&nbsp; But even that would be useful, because then we could
                <br />
                outsource a part of this.&nbsp; Please also get whatever specs that we gave OUP for widget writing.)
                <br />
                <br />
                I think we will need some significant information from
                <b>
                 <font>
                  AI

                    <font>

                   <font>
                    Please describe the minisite! Is the minisite related to the taxonomy in any way, or is it based on some other organizing principle?&nbsp; If
                    <br />
                    so, I think that is a separate discussion from the Taxonomy Discussion, though it would be a second use case (with a recommendation widget being the first use case).&nbsp; I think you need to talk with Todd about any minisite plans.&nbsp; My recommendation (not a widget!) would be to figure out how to populate subject collections with the taxonomy info (which we do for Semio in the BMJ).&nbsp; But I don't know that the minisite is related to the taxonomy.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It is very important for a minisite that we know the sources of info to be displayed.
                    <br />
                    &gt;
                    <br />
                    It is also very important for a recommendation widget that we know whether it will be displaying non-highwire sources of content.

       &gt;&gt; But we need a project manager for this, especially given that the publication manager is Cathy Cardon, currently working in Colorado.
       <br />
       &gt;&gt;
       <br />
       &gt;&gt; Let me know if I should do something.

        I think Helen Atkins would

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; agree with this (some clients think WE should do this rather than
        <br />
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they; I think Helen would not feel that way).
        <br />
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        <br />
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We should have a well-written PRD to offer as a model, along with the&nbsp; template.
        <br />
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        <br />
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And someone (perhaps MarkC) should be the designated intended

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recipient of the PRD so that person can judge that it is good enough
        <br />
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to get going with.
        <br />
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't think that will quite answer Margie's questions, since she

           Ron suggested that I ask for your input on this. We've got a multi-org
           <br />
           task floating around out there (with Sudhanshu, Eileen, Rachel, and either
           <br />
           John or Tina) and I am not sure how to move it forward.
           <br />
           <br />
           Sudhanshu has some stuff to do with the service itself; described below.
           <br />
           <br />
           Eileen has to do some stuff with the UI; I don't know what apart from
           <br />
           &quot;widgets&quot;.
           <br />
           <br />
           Rachel has to do some stuff with the UI; I don't know what.
           <br />
           <br />
           John (or Tina) has to do some stuff with the UI; I don't know what.
           <br />
           <br />
           Clearly the main problem I'm having is that I don't know how to describe
           <br />
           who is doing what, or how it all falls together. Sudhanshu has been clear
           <br />
           about the scope and timing of his work, but Rachel has not been clear
           <br />
           about hers (and Eileen's and John/Tina's).
           <br />
           <br />
           Do you have any suggestions? Shall I create four tasks (Sudhanshu, Eileen,
           <br />
           Rachel, John/Tina) with Rachel cc'd on all of the UI stuff, do you think?

  &gt; Mark,
  <br />
  &gt;
  <br />
  &gt; For Enforme, I've sent off an email asking Eric Delente (CEO) to clarify the extent of their Drupal practice.&nbsp; (I don't believe Astute does Drupal. If someone knows otherwise, let me know.)
  <br />
  &gt;
  <br />
  &gt; Tom is going to schedule a time for Tom, me and Eric to talk about the business arrangements.
  <br />
  &gt;
  <br />
  &gt; If Enforme isn't the right partner, then I think we need to search among your list of offshores and others we have considered.
  <br />
  &gt;
  <br />
  &gt; I think conceptually the approach with a partner is that we are doing &quot;co development&quot; (as with BMJ) but in this case we are the prime contractor for both parts of the &quot;co&quot;.&nbsp; However, it still needs to be clarified who does what before Enforme (or anybody else) can provide us pricing on this.&nbsp; So I think until we can assign a project manager for this (would we do that before we formally get the contract?) you and Todd should talk about this clarification as you suggest below.&nbsp; Christine Crane is the pub manager (she is on vacation through the end of next week now).
  <br />
  &gt;
  <br />
  &gt; We have a pretty complete functional spec.&nbsp; We spent Tuesday pruning it a bit.&nbsp; (Todd was involved in it all Tuesday.)
  <br />
  &gt;
  <br />

  &gt;&gt; John, this is very exciting.&nbsp; Part of what's so exciting is that we're
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; finally in a position to actually get a contract w/Enforme and Astute.&nbsp; Of
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; course it's also exciting the customer is excited about working w/us.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; Before it would be reasonable to put together a proposal, we should have
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; &quot;inked&quot; contracts w/both.&nbsp; We will need to engage them (perhaps Enforme
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; first if they're the &quot;first choice&quot;) and they will have to estimate
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; they're part.&nbsp; As I understand this, there is a lot of &quot;custom&quot; work
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; here.&nbsp; I don't think it makes a lot of sense providing a proposal until
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; we understand what our Partner's engagement will be and what they're
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; estimate is for their part of the work.&nbsp; Even if we decide to &quot;shop out&quot;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; 100% of the work, we should plan on one full time PM and one full time HW
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; Engineer.&nbsp; We'll need to very clearly partition the work we do vs.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; partner.&nbsp; So, I hope we're making really good progress on the contract so
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; that can get wrapped up and we can start working w/them.&nbsp; I'm assuming
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; Drupal?&nbsp; I'll need to spend some time w/Todd and make sure we have a
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; reasonable plan to engage w/a partner... In looking back on some of the
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; projects we take on and aren't as successful as we'd like to be a common
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; theme is that we seem to rush through the &quot;investigation&quot; part and don't
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; put as much thought and diligence into the planning/investigation of the
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; project.&nbsp; It's very well documented that proper/diligent up front
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; planning not only helps ensure success, but also makes the going a lot
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; easier and avoids surprises.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; Given that our customers are generally pretty cheap, it'll be interesting
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; to see what having or engaging in a partnership such as Astute or Enforme
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; to deploy our customer's platforms will now cost vs. when we do it.&nbsp; My
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; experience has been sticker shock.&nbsp; Hopefully this will be different.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; By the way, we're going to be in a similar situation w/ASCO where we'll
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; definitely want to consider partnering (probably) with Astute.&nbsp; LOTS of
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; custom, but once it's developed, if we do it right working closely w/our
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; partner, we should then have new feature capabilities our competition
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; doesn't have.
  <br />

  &gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; Directors,
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; I think we had a very successful day and a half meeting with two senior
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; folks from pediatrics.&nbsp; The focus of the second day of the meeting was a
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; major portal project (it is larger than the JBJS portal project by
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; including more function and more data sources and more personalization,
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; but&nbsp; would also be done in Drupal if we do the work).&nbsp; Their alternatives
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; for&nbsp; implementing the project are to have it done by AAP's IT group, by
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; an&nbsp; external consulting group they have been working with on specs, info
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; architecture and wireframes, or by us.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; They want to go with us.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; We are pretty sure we need to outsource a part of the work to a
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; development&nbsp; partner, or else we tie up all our drupal resource in
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; another
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; single-customer project like the BMJ Redesign.&nbsp; So we will need to
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; identify&nbsp; our outsource partner (first to talk to is Enforme).
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; They came with a goal of launching in March.&nbsp; We told them we could help
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; with that by providing feeds but that we couldn't take development
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; responsibility for this large a project in that short a timeframe.&nbsp; They
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; they moved to a
  <font>
   &quot;friends and family&quot; trial period in late summer 2012,
   <br />
   <font>
    &gt;&gt; with&nbsp; a
    <font>
     launch for there major meeting in October.
     <font>
      <br />
      &gt;&gt;
      <br />
      &gt;&gt;
      <font>
       The next major step is for us to send them a proposal.
       <font>
        But
        <font>
         before that
         <font>
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; we&nbsp; need to confirm the spec changes we agreed to (all scaling things
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; back),&nbsp; and they need to confirm that the data sources are available to
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; us in a&nbsp; machine to machine way.&nbsp; Internally (as my note below to the
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; team says) we&nbsp; need to identify our incremental resources for doing this
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; project, in&nbsp; addition to what we want to outsource.
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; Michael Held called me Wednesday morning and told me how pleased they
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; were&nbsp; with the meeting and the partnership, with how much they learned in
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; the&nbsp; visit, and with the quality of our input and the amount of time we
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; spent&nbsp; with them.

          &gt;&gt; I&nbsp; think it

          &gt;&gt; was very successful.

          &gt;&gt; I talked for about 45 minutes privately this morning with Michael Held,
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; and&nbsp; he
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; considered it a big success.&nbsp; He got a lot of his questions answered, and
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; while he
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; and Joe didn't agree on everything when they had dinner last night
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; (MacArthur Park),
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; they did reach a consensus.&nbsp; Michael felt it was important that they had
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; a&nbsp; good list
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; of the issues.
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; Michael wants to move forward.&nbsp; But we have to have a clear agreement

          &gt;&gt; modules and
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; content were in what versions/releases, what they need to accomplish at
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; their end
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; (regarding content sources, iirc) and any other assumptions we believe
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; were&nbsp; confirmed
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; or changed.
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; We should decide on the internal resources we need to add to support this
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; project (in
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; addition to out sourced resources).&nbsp; E.g., a half time project manager?
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; a&nbsp; full time
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; drupal person to work on integration?&nbsp; other resources?
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; Michael also wants me privately to give him a ballpark so he can be sure
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; they have
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; the right number budgeted.
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; Michael also said that he had the task of telling Magnani that they were
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; doing the
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; fall deliverable mockup, but not the full implementation.&nbsp; So it was
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; clear&nbsp; that
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; Michael wants us to do the work.
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; Michael said Joe was a little concerned that they didn't know who our
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; partners were
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; for their project. Michael was not concerned about this.
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; While Michael and Joe agreed that a 'friends and family' test in the late
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; summer
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; before an October launch was wise, Michael wondered whether Pediatrics
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; would still be
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; &quot;ahead of the pack&quot; by shifting to October.&nbsp; He asked us to think about
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; that.
          <br />
          &gt;&gt;
          <br />
          &gt;&gt; So all in all a very good two days work.&nbsp; Thanks again.

   All,
   <br />
   <br />
   Jesse and I just spent some time catching up with Dax and Nick reviewing a couple
   <br />
   of the content-related issues that were presumed to be potentially problematic, and
   <br />
   thus possibly needing WARP input.
   <br />
   <br />
   Good news is, the work done on books using the
   <b>
    <font>
     NLM Book DTD
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    in H20 actually
    <br />
    solves many if not all of the problems we were concerned about, which had such
    <br />
    painful solutions in H10.
    <br />
    <br />
    So, we don't actually think there needs to be a WARP discussion of anything
    <br />
    for Redbook. (yay!)
    <br />
    <br />
    Christine,
    <br />
    <br />
    I'll send you some content notes under separate cover.

  JG: directory structure is completely unique.
  <br />
  KH: That means none of the migratino stratigies won't work.

  KH:&nbsp; TOC needs to show hierarchy that is independent of that.

  Just fyi ... in a Q1 Roadmap meeting today, the infrastructure needed to support books was discussed.�� This was on the roadmap for Q1, but focused on the ability to properly support our existing book sites:� aptaguide, SEPM books and ERM books.�� When I mentioned today's Redbook meeting and the timing needed for this content, it was stated that supporting Redbook was not a part of this Q1 infrastructure task.�� This just means we need to look at Redbook separately and not expect all the content to be supported by a Q1 infrastructure upgrade.�� Todd suggested we
  <font>
   look at supporting the 2012 Redbook content, and look at leaving the older content where it is
   <font>
    for the time being.��
    <br />
    <br />
    We should go ahead with the content meeting, but I wanted you to know about the general book strategy for Q1, as it is currently defined.�

  Hi Ron -
  <br />
  <br />
  This will be a migration / relaunch of the current RedBook site. Redbook is still in H1O and it was decided to wait until they repleased the 2012 version to move it into H2O. So, XML knowledge and the knowledge of a content transition is needed. The Core Elements below are elements that the H1O version does not have, so they need to be priced separately.
  <br />
  <br />
  Since this a custom project we'll need a well-written spec/PRD to deliver to Engineering. Jeff Mahoney is the principal stakeholder at AAP and communication between him and the Project Manager will be key.
  <br />
  <br />
  I have no book sites (just inherited this one) and therefore, no knowledge of the books platform. So, a project manager familair with books and familiar with what custom work we can do that is in line with the platform book work Anh is working on would be helpful as well.
  <br />
  <br />
  I can delay having a meeting with AAP, letting them know I am working on getting a Project Manager assigned. Shall I set up a meeting with Bernie next week or is email sufficient?
  <br />
  <br />
  Thanks!
  <br />

  AAP is launching the 2012 version of RedBook early next summer and we are going to need a project manager to handle this large-scale project with custom requirements.
  <br />
  <br />
  Anh was in on an initial meeting with me a couple of weeks ago and she said the time frame for development of the books platform is not going to fit the time frame of this AAP launch.
  <br />
  <br />
  I'll be setting up a call with AAP stakeholders next week and would like a Project Manager in the meeting with me. They'll need to write up the high-level requirements in more detail and probably take them to WARP for scoping. Anh has offered to review the full requirements list in advance and let us know what is in the current book platform and what isn't. This already on Louise's key projects list for 2012. A summary of the project thus far is below:
  <br />
  <br />

    </a>
   </font>
  </b>
  <font>
   <br />
   <br />
   We�hope that the 2012 Red Book on Red Book Online will coincide with the largest &quot;leap forward&quot; with the RBO platform on HighWire since our initial launch back in 2003. We plan to increasingly position Red Book Online as the &quot;go-to&quot; pediatric infectious diseases resource for AAP members/pediatric health professionals�for the latest Red Book content and more�(with less emphasis on the print edition, which is still VERY popular).

   In order to position this in this way, we need Red Book Online to be enhanced to be able to effectively deliver the Red Book Online content &amp; updates in the places where members are accessing it - whether desktop, smartphone, or tablet. We've seen that HighWire is making good steps in these directions, so we'll need good, open dialogue about what is possible through the HighWire platform for the 2012 edition (including what will NOT be possible yet in 2012). Because of the importance of this initiative for the AAP, AAP has discussed perhaps having a follow-up &quot;in-person&quot;�meeting out there at HighWire with the key HighWire team - to make sure all the bases are covered. Please keep this in-person meeting in mind (we're thinking perhaps sometime�in the�Nov. 10-20 range...October is tough because of our annual meeting) as we begin the conversations via calls and e-mails.
   <br />

   If some of you aren't that familiar with the overall Red Book product line, feel free to visit our new AAP Red Book page on Facebook�at
   <a href="http://www.facebook.com/aapredbook">
    www.facebook.com/aapredbook
   </a>
   (it just launched a month ago, but it can give you a quick surface glimpse of the Red Book &quot;family&quot; of products).

    <br />
    3. Adding image references within text (which will be online-only, not in the print edition)

    4. Red Book Online Updates - incorporated in text (look at AAP's Pediatric Care Online to see our updates on there)

    No breakdown yet; Ron and Margo are planning to meet (today, I believe) to
    <br />
    talk about how to help Rachel move her part forward.
    <br />
    <br />
    Eileen has indicated that she can't do anything vis a vis widgets until
    <br />
    the underlying XSLT work is done, so Rachel is the choke point at the
    <br />
    moment.
    <br />
    <br />
    Sudhanshu still has work to do, and is making progress, but his stuff can
    <br />
    proceed in parallel with the rest.
    <br />
    <br />
    I'll keep you posted.

      Most of the

        <br />

        Hi Sudhanshu,
        <br />
        <br />
        Just got out of a meeting with folks who are keen to get a handle on the
        <br />
        status of the VJ project (for AAP, to start). Can you confirm that your
        <br />
        work on the VJ service itself is pretty much complete? If there is still
        <br />
        work yet to be done, can you provide an estimate of how many hours/days
        <br />
        you're looking at, and when you expect to finish up?
        <br />
        <br />
        Thanks!
        <br />

              Margo et al say that
              <br />
              you estimated NeoReviews' Virtual Journal work at 1-2 weeks of work
              <br />

              <br />
              <br />
              Can you take a second look at your estimate, whether we can hand off any parts of it or divide the problem in some way to get this done sooner than later? We can discuss tomorrow. (I just proposed moving our 1on1 from Friday to tomorrow. Time ok?)

  Hello Karen,
  <br />
  <br />
  Please find the updated schedule as per our conversation
  <br />
  this morning.�� One of the changes you will notice is the
  <br />
  Cut back-end to prod date.
  <br />
  <br />
  The site team asked us to target 9/6 for cutting the back-end
  <br />
  to prod. This date is while you are on vacation,� which is not
  <br />
  problematic, since you and Jason don't need to do anything
  <br />
  for the cut itself.� After the cut, you simply have to remember
  <br />
  to make changes to both the H1O and H2O File Manager
  <br />
  directories.�� I will send out a reminder to you and Jason
  <br />
  following the cut to prod.
  <br />
  <br />
  Please feel free to ask any questions.
  <br />
  <br />
  Mahesh

  COW is 3 pages: 1st page, the legends, the solution.
  <br />
  There wil be a template for each.
  <br />
  <br />
  Same thing for image quizzes.
  <br />
  They're bringing in polldaddy bits, and
  <br />
  it'll also just be a template with relevant calls.&nbsp; (won't need a call to jquery)
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Special collections will also have a template.
  <br />
  <br />
  SC rationalized their crazy CSS.&nbsp; As much shared as possible.&nbsp; Ex., move up to parent sheet for shared stuff.&nbsp; Their styles weren't fully qualified, ours were trumping them.
  <br />
  <br />
  SC: I'm hoping I give them what they had before.
  <br />
  <br />
  SC: Templates go by folder.&nbsp; IF you don't want the features, they an take out all the BETWEEN HERE AND HERE markers.
  <br />
  Workflow will be the same, but the specifics are different (No DTL)
  <br />
  It'll have magnification, javascript, etc.

  Hi Mahesh,
  <br />
  <br />
  Now that Karen and Jason can get to the beta site, and though they know they
  <br />
  are to focus on the content, they are extremely concerned with the home
  <br />
  page. Here are their notes just so we have them:
  <br />
  <br />
  1) The home page is completely scaled wrong and is larger than what they had
  <br />
  before. They don't want it to be.
  <br />
  <br />
  2) The home page was custom, they want it to be just as it was before. A I
  <br />
  won't mention all she said because I believe it's just enough to say that it
  <br />
  needs to be like it was.
  <br />
  <br />
  3) They noticed that the current issue to review has the same problem we
  <br />
  just fixed on the live site with the
  <font>
   toc ordering
   <font>
    . We'll need to be sure
    <br />
    that is o.k. I believe a toc manifest will solve that situation.
    <br />
    <br />
    4) They will probably request that the fonts be fixed. For instance, see the
    <br />
    toc between H1O and H2O.
    <br />

    Hi Mahesh,
    <br />
    <br />
    Good morning! I've been on the phone with Karen who is quite upset (sorry).
    <br />
    She is correct that she can't get to the beta site with her un/pw. I tried
    <br />
    as well. Then when she got to the 4040 site, she didn't realize she had to
    <br />
    key in the &quot;/maint&quot; to get to the File Manager pages. So that brought up her
    <br />
    comments that the site looked bad.
    <br />
    <br />
    Of course when you get to the FM pages, as she did once I explained, she
    <br />
    can't get to the view of anything that is in beta.
    <br />
    <br />
    They thought they were going to see the beta site in a more final form, once
    <br />
    they see it; so again she is rather panicked because of all of the caveats.
    <br />
    And she said that she was never told that this was focused on the content
    <br />
    and was thinking they were going to have to look at every single issue. I
    <br />
    pointed her to the top of the document where it mentions just the 3 issues.
    <br />
    Then she didn't understand why content would change anyway.
    <br />
    <br />
    She wanted to cancel the call this week, but I suggested that she wait until
    <br />
    she gets access to the beta site to have some more perspective of what she'd
    <br />
    be seeing. She's o.k. with that approach.
    <br />
    <br />
    And then she can't get to the Google doc and doesn't want to create a google
    <br />
    un/pw. I let her know that it is using her regular e-mail address; but she
    <br />
    can't get past the page where it is asking for her google info.
    <br />
    <br />
    She said that in no way can they migrate on the target date provided. She is
    <br />
    very nervous how that can ever happen. I've calmed her down for now, but we
    <br />
    have some work to do to get some level of comfort.
    <br />
    <br />
    I was going to contact Jeff Plautz to see if he could get the beta site up
    <br />
    to use her un/pw, but he's on vacation.
    <br />
    <br />
    And so that you know, it is not just H2O that is on her mind. There are some
    <br />
    other fairly major items such as minisites, and iPhone apps that are not
    <br />
    going as she had hoped.
    <br />
    <br />
    Let me know how I can help, and good luck!
    <br />
    <br />
    Oh, she said the EIC does not like the pop-up abstracts at all. She's not
    <br />
    asking us to turn them off, but wants to know if that is an option if he
    <br />
    insists on it.

  Mahesh and Bernard
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Continue on weekly meetings (now: Thursdays noon eastern / 9 am
  <br />
  <br />
  ** .&nbsp;&nbsp; )
  <br />
  We said that wasn't acceptable.
  <br />
  <br />
  Cathy called with this on Monday, and she asked if we were asked to moving the launch date
  <br />
  <br />
  We specifiedcally asked re: vacation dates....
  <br />
  <br />
  Thursday specifically mention out pull
  <br />
  <br />
  Team members ahve been added re: the FM page migration.
  <br />
  <br />
  =============================================
  <br />
  <br />
  Man: cobbled together.&nbsp; Learned on fly over past. In head Jquery, in head-css. How were' doing separate style sheets.
  <b>
   <font>
    If that posed any problems.
   </font>
  </b>
  <font>
   <br />
   <br />
   DOES IN HEAD MADE ANY PROBLEMS? Ex., messiest wexample. &quot;Week&quot; panel on home page, it's in a false head tag. In order to style that ourselves, CSS is put in there....
   <br />
   Heads in middle of pages...
   <br />
   <br />
   How linked DTL pages would tranfser
   <br />
   One dtl page points to another. Ex., COW dtl, and youg et to name anothe rvariable. Linked by filename. 4 different sections. Slide 1 through 4... linked by
   <br />
   directory with date
   <br />
   DTL calls file name
   <br />
   All the files have 07052011 if the're part of the same product. Called by
   <br />
   Will that carry over?
   <br />
   <br />
   When we do indexes for these products, these URLs are hardcoded??
   <br />
   AJNR, on the site itself. LIke an archive.
   <br />
   Archived by date and diagnosis.
   <br />
   WHAT DO DO WITH THE INDEXES, AND WITH USERES WHO HAVE BOOKMARKED THE DTL PAGES.
   <br />
   <br />
   220 cases?&nbsp; since 2007.
   <br />
   <br />
   earlier ones were simplier in layout. Image in HTML page

  2.&nbsp; File manager challenges - Karen is converting and migrating FM pages, but Sara was looking specifically at their Case of the Week (COW) pages to come up with an approach for their maintenance of those pages.&nbsp; Am assuming there will be some set of directions coming out of Sara's work there?

  <br />
  3.&nbsp; Functionality and TOC styling - Karen - we need to make sure that their functionality is in place for alpha review and their TOC supports icons and shading.&nbsp; Since this is a big part of their TOC, and I believe their content needs to be adjusted to support the icons (?), this really should be in place on the sample content by turnover on 8/8.&nbsp;&nbsp; (We can note it as a caveat for internal testing, if needed)

  As far as the rest of the schedule, with proposals for sample content, this seems to give ample time to work with the content and launch by Dec 1st.�� I would think we would
  <font>

   <font>
    , to get it loaded, make sure the features are in place, have the site run through internal QA, fix those reported problems -- I would think we would not be able to have the site ready for a final review until about 10/24?� We can have them focus on the content first, and give us feedback on that, so that we can get the issue delivery by Nov 3.� Even if the delivery is a week later, we should be fine with a 12/1 launch.

  <br />
  In terms of the h20 site, it has the basic styling and is cloning the Oncologist currently
  <font>
   without all the extras from filemanager pages
   <font>
    that the Oncologist has. I asked about images previously and we only have a small amount to work with so things like adverts are all still being displayed from the Oncologist setup. All the links are done at the moment the h20 display site is really almost all we have.
    <br />
    <br />
    There is some work probably needed on the h10 site since its a new launch which Max is covering and will probably need some work. There will also be some additional work once those features are setup on the h20 side.
    <br />
    <br />
    From the site perspective I guess the only things we are really missing from the publisher is any sort of
    <b>
     <font>
      cover image
     </font>
    </b>
    <font>
     and when they get the site, the filemanager parts of their homepage.
     <br />
     <br />
     I hope from a site perspective that gives some clarity.

     <br />
     I will appreciate if you and Bert can help me get the clarification for the following content related questions from publishers:
     <br />
     <br />
     1) assuming the site launch happens in september,
     <b>
      <font>
       will we have the PAP launch
      </font>
     </b>
     <font>
      shortly after site launch? If so, when will that be?
      <br />
      <br />
      2) since SCTM will be an exact clone of the Oncologist, does that mean the
      <br />
      first issue of SCTM will have the
      <b>
       <font>
        following features
       </font>
      </b>
      <font>
       ?
       <br />
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two level TOC
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Annotated TOC
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eletters
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Access Article
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CME
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coverlines
       <br />
       <br />
       3) Will SCTM have supplements at launch or after launch?
       <br />
       <br />
       4) when we should expect the sample content and when should expect the first issue?
       <br />
       <br />
       Here is an example of file delivery timeline:
       <br />
       assuming the launch date is Dec 1st (Thursday):
       <br />
       <br />
       **sample issue should be provided no later than Oct 3rd
       <br />
       **Oct 4-13 sample issue stages in dev site, alpha review, resupply requests
       <br />
       **Oct 14-28 beta site review, publisher provides feedback no later than Nov 24, resupply requests
       <br />
       **launch issue arrives on Nov 3rd, Thursday (one month before launch date)
       <br />
       **launch issue stages in prod site no later than Nov 7, Monday
       <br />
       **Nov 10-17 beta site review and feedback from publisher
       <br />
       **Nov 18-23 ask for feedback and reload/resatge
       <br />
       **launch issue produces in prod on Nov 24 (one week before launch date)
       <br />
       **issue launches on Dec 1st
       <br />
       <br />
       Note: this is just a sample. Date change can be affected by alpha site and beta site availability. Hope it can give you some ideas about the timeline.
       <br />

       <br />
       AMP is visiting Bert on Monday, and they're going to need an update about the SCTM launch.�� I have not been involved in this launch (and the PMO will not be assuming responsibility for it), but I'm trying to help Bert and Laura.� I'm trying to assemble the evidence.�
       <br />
       <br />
       Evidently, this launch was under way, but seems to have stalled, perhaps with Cathy's departure.
       <br />
       There is an alpha site shell with some styling
       <br />
       <a href="http://alpha.stemcellstm.alphamedpress.org/">
        http://alpha.stemcellstm.alphamedpress.org/
       </a>
       <br />
       <br />
       Further, there's a simple LOA, which says
       <br />
       <font>
        <br />
        * the site shall launch in late August
        <br />
        * this site shall be an exact clone of the Oncologist
        <a href="http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/">
         http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/
        </a>
        , except for not having
        <br />
        ��� - enhanced international delivery
        <br />
        ��� - Google enhanced metadata delivery
        <br />
        * same content workflow as the Oncologist
        <br />
        * self-op PDF-only PAP
        <br />
        * Open journal, no access control
        <br />
        * new journal, no backfile
        <br />
        <font>
         <br />
         The customer, I believe, now expects to have content for a December content-full launch. (December launches can be far from ideal, so we have to be careful here.)
         <br />
         The customer wants us to launch a content-less site in the near term.�� Margo feels that we could target mid September for this -- let's say 15 September.�
         <br />
         <br />
         Margo believes that if we do not see reliable content samples before the final content is delivered, we will need 4 weeks between the delivery of the final content, and the re-launch of the� site with full content.� If they deliver good quality samples in advance, we might be able to reduce that lag somewhat.�� The challenges that are most important here are testing all of our features that rely on content, and getting the customer to sign off on article display and related.
         <br />
         <br />
         QUESTIONS:
         <br />
         1. do I have any of my facts wrong?
         <br />
         2. am I missing anything important?
         <br />
         3. do you know of any contraindications for the proposed launch events?
         <br />
         4. who has a sense of what else remains to be done?
         <br />
         5. are there info, materials, or decisions we need from the publisher before we can move forward?
         <br />
         <br />
         Any insights welcome, as we get this onto its final track to success.
         <br />

         Hi Bert,
         <br />
         <br />
         The key to this effort is getting a realistic sense of
         <font>
          when we will have content to work with.�
          <font>
           We can back up from that, and figure about a 3 month effort (maybe a bit more), in general.�� It is inefficient for us to start on this project, and then have to put it down because of lack of content, so the best tactic here is to understand the content schedule, and build the launch schedule based on that.�� Once this content timing is understood, yes, I think we should chat internally and put a new plan together that more closely reflects reality - ideally, before Marty is out here for a visit.
           <br />

    Hi Bill, Sharon--
 
 I went through the LOA amendment with AMP today (attached) and they have noted some differences that I wanted to bring to your attention:
 
 ----they DO want EID and Google Enhanced metadata delivery...this was specifically excluded in the attached amendment and should be added back in for continuing service charges. Marty says he does not know why these would have been excluded.
    <br />
    <font>
     SMcC: OK. $175/issue for EID and $35/issue for Google enhanced metadata delivery. We will not amend the LOA for this; this email is sufficient.
     <font>
      <br />
      --no AC, but they do want to install a custom demographics feature. We charged them $7K to add this to theoncologist...please advise what (if any) charge should be added for installing this on the new website at launch. Is this considered to be a &quot;clone&quot; of theoncologist?
      <br />
      <font>
       SMcC: $5,500. That's $5K for the second installation ($2K reduced from $7K first installation); plus $500 because it's part of an expedited launch schedule.
       <font>
        <br />
        --they want mobile web (this is also in the queue for theoncologist and is being charged full price). Do we charge full price for this feature?
        <br />
        <font>
         SMcC: Presumably the full price AMP has been quoted for mobile web for The Oncologist is $6,000 one-time and $90/month on-going. The charge for the second journal will be $4,000 one-time and $60/month on-going. However, I'd assume that they would in actuality want us to charge each journal the same for on-going; $75/month for each. Please confirm.
         <font>
          <br />
          Thanks for your patience with the ever-evolving landscape that is AMP!

          Bill, Cathy,
 
 OK, the LOA is signed AND the first payment is in hand, on schedule for what we told Marty he'd need to do to achieve a launch date of &quot;late August&quot; for Stem Cells Translational Medicine. Will you enter a launch set and take it from here?

   Some of the more critical milestones are as follows:
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 04 Oct:&nbsp; Conference call with customer to initialize project
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 05 Oct:&nbsp; Review/Complete Installables

     <br />
     <br />
     NOTE: If we can accelerate this next bit, so that site work is
     <br />
     done by 14 Oct (one week earlier), that would be best, but if
     <br />
     not:

   Of the ATS journals, the older two (ajrccm, ajrcmb) will be very
   <br />
   challenging.� Like Pediatrics, they
   <b>
    <font>
     both have sub-issue supplements,
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    <br />
    which will need to be accommodated with H10 reloading. So I don't
    <br />
    think we can cut into the typical migration schedule for this one.

      First, there is a baseline upgrade that needs to happen to the CME site to work with the H2O journals. This is free, but has to be coordinated.
      <br />
      <br />
      Second, the CME site

      <font>

   Hi Ellen,
   <br />
   <br />
   FWIW, here are my notes from today's call. Do with them what you will!
   <br />
   <br />
   Mahesh, thanks so much for remembering to bring some of last week's more
   <br />
   critical items back to the table today!
   <br />
   <br />
   I'm going to step off ATS now, but let me know if I can help at all going
   <br />
   forward. Feels to me like it's under control. :)
   <br />
   <br />
   Note: Among the most important points covered today, the group agreed that
   <br />
   it would be best to shift target date from 30 Nov to 6 Dec, both to allow
   <br />
   extra time for content loading, as well as to guard against the
   <br />
   possibility that ATS may yet decide that they can't Beta starting on 17
   <br />
   Oct. (May also be helpful if content briefing is pursued.) Xenia will
   <br />
   confirm this with Bill and others and update Next_100 as appropriate.
   <br />
   <br />
   Angie

   Angie de Villiers
   <br />
   Project Manager
   <br />
   HighWire Press
   <br />
   <br />
   Greg: ReadMe was sent years ago, will resend now.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <font>
    QuickStart will also be sent this week.
    <font>
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, let's go with design #2 for all sites.
     <br />
     <br />
     Lorena: Two face-lifted, three were not. Did
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; facelift on CME in dev, so it's
     <font>
      pretty
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; much done.
      <font>
       Umbrella and procats not yet
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; face-lifted.
       <br />
       <br />
       Greg: Procats needs an
       <font>
        adaptation of design #2.
        <font>
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Customer has been given examples of H2O
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; umbrellas so that they can select one.
         <br />
         <br />
         Paul: We should do umbrella beta at the same time as
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the journal beta.
         <br />
         <br />
         Greg: Phoned ATS this morning to ask about his
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; availability to conduct Beta week of 17 Oct;
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he will tell us yes or no by the end of next week.
         <br />
         <br />
         Ellen: Is he the only one doing QA?
         <br />
         <br />
         Greg: Will check.
         <br />
         <br />
         Ellen/Max: Doing the migration right after the Thanksgiving holiday seems unwise.
         <br />
         <br />
         Xenia: We can float the idea to the directors re:&nbsp; moving the date out into early December if
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desired. Is this a more complex project that&nbsp; does need more time in the schedule?
         <br />
         <br />
         Priscilla: There are some complications in the content; lots of different eras, including
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff converted by DCL. There are likely&nbsp; to be problems.
         <br />
         <br />
         Greg:
         <font>
          Abstract issues are pretty big
          <font>
           , one per year;&nbsp; some recent Retro.
           <br />
           <br />
           Lorena: Procats has a lot of supplemental issues.
           <br />
           <br />
           Paul: Probably OK to do on the 6th; clinchem can go at the same time as ATS.
           <br />
           <br />
           Ellen: Can we be content-complete 2 weeks in&nbsp; advance of the 6th?
           <br />
           <br />
           Priscilla: Hard to say this far in advance, but it&nbsp; is quite far out there so it's still a
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possibility.
           <br />
           <br />
           Paul: Recommends keeping Beta at the same date,&nbsp; and to add the extra week for content
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loading.
           <br />
           <br />
           Xenia: Is 3 Oct alpha date OK with the developers?
           <br />
           <br />
           &lt;crickets&gt; ... but yes. They are nodding.
           <br />
           <br />
           Max: H1O analysis, standard views, custom flags.
           <br />
           <br />
           Greg:
           <font>
            ajrccm TOC is really complicated on H1O
            <font>
             ; procats has TOC manifest on H1O.
             <br />
             <br />
             Ellen: Manifests are standard for all migrated&nbsp; issues.
             <br />
             <br />
             Xenia: Karen needs to take extra care when generating the manifests.
             <br />
             <br />
             Greg: Yes, we should
             <font>
              have them submit manifests
              <font>
               for all the sites
               <font>
                following
                <font>
                 migration; DJS is the
                 <br />
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file provider.
                 <br />
                 <br />
                 Ellen: Greg should explain to customer why manifests are needed on H2O.
                 <br />
                 <br />
                 Lorena: Max will deal with sample issues: 3 for&nbsp; procats CME, 1 for each of the other 2.
                 <br />
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Only procats publishes CME, but the other two are set up for it.)
                 <br />
                 <br />
                 Ellen: We
                 <font>
                  don't have procats in NLM XML, yet;
                  <font>
                   expected any day now.
                   <br />
                   <br />
                   Greg: ATS is getting mobile soon; had conversation&nbsp; with them this morning, it will be 10-12
                   <br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weeks after migration that they will be able to do it.
                   <br />
                   <br />
                   Lorena: When we did a facelift for the CME sites,&nbsp; the mobile is baked into it at the same
                   <br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time; suppressing mobile CME is probably harder than leaving it in.
                   <br />
                   <br />
                   Greg: Can we bake mobile into journal migrations?
                   <br />
                   <br />
                   Ellen: Don't typically want to add functionality&nbsp; during a migration.
                   <br />
                   <br />
                   Greg: We do need to add Google Analytics.
                   <br />
                   <br />
                   Lorena: Would like to know if anybody cares that&nbsp; CME has mobile when sites do not. She's
                   <br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; going to do it unless instructed otherwise.
                   <br />
                   <br />
                   Ellen: We should discuss this internally. Greg should do it.
                   <br />
                   <br />
                   Max: Home page announcements, volume supplements,
                   <b>
                    <font>
                     meeting abstracts,

                   <font>

                    <br />
                    Paul: Nothing worrying. Sri and Chris
                    <font>
                     have done&nbsp; meeting abstracts before
                     <font>
                      if help is needed.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Greg: Nothing super custom in terms of features.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Xenia: Has received request to generate content inventory; she'll do it for the MPP.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Priscilla: Will estimate conversion and loading, and advise if meeting content-complete
                      <br />
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; date looks risky.

                      Xenia: Content is pretty valid, Keton era has&nbsp; already been converted.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Priscilla: Content converted by vendors may be&nbsp; valid but still require additional

                      <br />
                      Xenia: This project may merit a second resource to help with the loading.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Ellen: All three journals will be beta'd.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Xenia: We want to load three sample issues, at&nbsp; most, from all older eras for all journals
                      <br />
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the prod/content site, so that Jeff can&nbsp; get started.

                      <br />
                      Ellen: Paul Bernard will work with the Prod Spec&nbsp; to get HWX workflows and conf files in
                      <br />
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place. That's Anthony. Will take as&nbsp; action.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Angie: NLM XML trans complete; first NLM XML for procats not yet here.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Xenia: We'll use two different eras for procats. If there are content-related feedback item
                      <br />
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the transition issue, sometimes there are issues. We should ask Paul Bernard to
                      <br />
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help with assessing feedback.

                      <br />
                      Greg: Content for issues is coming from a&nbsp; different provider than P&lt;P: DJS/Sheridan
                      <br />
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does issues, and ScholarOne does P&lt;P.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Max: We need them to tell us what links they&nbsp; want in col-3 on H2O; Greg will request.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Angie: Recommends a review of MDDB ASAP.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Mahesh: Do we need to do a

                       <font>

                        <br />
                        Xenia: Will discuss with Greg and Bill; if we do need one, pan-era sample needs to be
                        <br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; converted and loaded sooner rather than&nbsp; later.

                        <br />
                        Ellen: Let's get content sites up ASAP in case&nbsp; we do pursue content briefing doc.

  Lorena wants procats updated CME
  <br />
  She redid the CME in dev... H2O...&nbsp; She really wants to get Procats (conference proceedings) to get up in H2O.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  XPS: Self-op PAP =&gt; HWX . Paul Bernard assigned to that, and all NLM XML transitions. For PAP and issue workflows.
  <br />
  On track for the new schedule...
  <br />
  <br />
  GB: &quot;I'm just going to tell him it's going to be end of November. He's going to want it to be earlier, but I'm just gonna say we need that time for transition, etc....&quot;
  <br />
  <br />
  XPS: We can bypass the publisher review of the NLM transition. Alternative is to do both reviews.
  <br />
  <font>
   H10 demo is how it used to be done, and that takes a long time, to make it ...
   <br />
   GB: I think we should, it's a nitpicker. We'll do the review in H2O.
   <font>
    <br />
    XPS: OK. That means we are solely responsible to do the
    <font>
     transition QA,
     <font>
      and we'll make the calls about what we fix, and what we let go. That implies that that first issue in H1O (in NLM) for each title
      <br />
      Content accuracy and completeness
      <font>
       . But formatting (comma vs semicolon in reference), we'll focus on it in H2O.
       <font>
        <br />
        We'll still train them in HWX.
        <br />
        <br />
        GB: I'll tell them that's the way we're going to go.
        <br />
        <br />
        GB: has a ton of stuff in QB, ... ex., GOogle analytics.
        <br />
        MK: We could that have in place for migration

        <font>
         GB: TOC is very hacked
         <font>
          . Alpha characters were added to keep the articles in order.&nbsp; Procats uses a manifest. I'd like them to do it for the other two, but he doesn't want to pay for it.
          <br />
          MK: IN H2O if manifest is delivered, it gets used.

          XPS: mutiple eras, transitions not done; ART HW, medline, Keton, etc.&nbsp; Sub-issue supplements.&nbsp; Will require a little more attention to conversion and QA.&nbsp; The Keton content has already been converted by DCL. But hasn't been QA'd.
          <br />
          <br />
          XPS: Remind customer, beta review is only sample content. (Our 1 transition issues, and a couple of artHW recent issues.)

  <br />
  Dom:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ReadMe/QuickStart still with BIR; they're very busy,
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slow to respond.
  <br />
  <br />
  Jeff:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alpha sites won't be ready for 7 Oct; maybe by 12/13
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oct.

  2. Critical milestones
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - status of QuickStart
  <br />
  <br />
  Dom:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still with BIR.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - Beta review dates approval (21-28 Oct)

  Dom:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still with BIR.
  <br />
  <br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; highlight importance of the Beta week.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - content inventory, conversion and loading estimates
  <br />
  <br />
  Kin:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <font>
   Not that much content to convert; a bit of content
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to gapfill; maybe 3-4 days to convert/gapfill. About
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 week to load. Some issues have been identified as
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NLM, but can't locate the source files.

      3. Specific areas of concern
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - any custom A/C?
      <br />
      <br />
      Alan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Custom messaging. Subscription pages are not in the
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; umbrella with links going from child to umbrella,
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unusual. Often try to centralize during migration, but
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if there are customizations required don't need to.
      <br />
      <br />
      Dom:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead and centralize. Implement at umbrella level.
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - building and styling 4 sites (3 journal sites, 1 umbrella)
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in parallel
      <br />
      <br />
      Bernard: This is a Paul/Margo question, and unfortunately Paul
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was not invited to kickoff; that said, it looks pretty
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; straightforward.
      <br />
      <br />
      Xenia:&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of cookie-cutter sites, we do a subset; lots of
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; variations we do all.
      <br />
      <br />
      Dom:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will recommend doing all testing on bjradio.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bernard: Gregory will confirm with Paul.
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION:&nbsp; Gregory/Angie will discuss with Paul, given info
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about unusual archive loading/display concerns for
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dmfr/imaging.
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - challenges associated with multi-site Beta review
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - time required for content conversion, loading
      <br />
      <br />
      Kin:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some concerns (see above).
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      -----------------
      <br />
      4. Other
      <br />
      <br />

     IMPORTANT: Adding PAP to imaging and dmfr in parallel. Due to finish Oct 12th, 2011.

   <font>
    <br />
    <br />
    Client does not have subscriber updates---they do everything manually.
    <br />
    <br />
    Dom already sent the Quick Start Guide, ReadMe, and an overview milestone schedule (derived from the project schedule) to the client [schedule is subject to revision after this meeting]. Has not heard back from client.
    <br />
    <b>
     <font>

      Action item for Dom: follow up with client on materials sent, particularly Quick Start (done)

     <br />
     <br />
     <br />
     Judith will be the Publication Manager for the project. Dom will assist.
     <br />
     <br />
     Paul B was inadvertantly left off the invite. Dom to catch up.

     </b>
     <font>
      <br />
      There have been copy flow issues with some of the content on dmfr and imaging. Client sometimes submitted content out of order or late. No content since 2009 in one area. Did some H10 fixes to make the TOC work properly, may affect the migration.
      <br />
      <br />
      Note: post production content freeze is in two days.
      <br />
      <br />
      Publisher will keep the same URLs (no change).

        ��- content inventory, conversion and loading estimates
        <br />
        <br />
        Kin: ����Not that much content to convert; a bit of content
        <br />
        ��������to gapfill; maybe 3-4 days to convert/gapfill. About
        <br />
        ��������1 week to load. Some issues have been identified as

        <br />
        ��- any custom A/C?
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        ��������umbrella with links going from child to umbrella,
        <br />
        ��������unusual. Often try to centralize during migration, but
        <br />
        ��������if there are customizations required don't need to.
        <br />
        <br />
        DECISION: Dom: ����Go ahead and centralize. Implement at umbrella level.
        <br />
        <br />
        ��- building and styling 4 sites (3 journal sites, 1 umbrella)
        <br />
        ����in parallel
        <br />
        <br />
        Bernard: This is a Paul/Margo question, and unfortunately Paul
        <br />
        ��������was not invited to kickoff; that said, it looks pretty
        <br />
        ��������straightforward
        <br />
        Xenia: ��Lots of cookie-cutter sites, we do a subset; if there are lots of
        <br />
        ��������variations between the sites, we do them all, instead.
        <br />
        <br />
        Dom: ����Will recommend doing all testing on bjradio.
        <br />
        <br />

 Hi Angie,
    <br />
    <br />
    I have only contacted Dom and Judith to schedule the migration kickoff
    <br />
    meeting.� Judith is going to be the Pub Mgr after the kickoff mtg.
    <br />
    <br />
    I will not perform any more work on BIR.

     Hi Mahesh,
     <br />
     <br />
     Bernard and I just met to try our hands at workload balancing as we
     <br />
     prepare to bring a new PjM on board (Gregory Close) tomorrow. After
     <br />
     reviewing all of your projects, we decided to have him pick up BIR
     <br />
     (kicking off next week), to start.
     <br />
     <br />
     It's likely that we'll make one or two other adjustments sometime next
     <br />
     week, but I wanted to give you a heads-up on this one before you get too
     <br />
     involved.
     <br />
     <br />
     If you've gotten started already, would you mind just summarizing current
     <br />
     status and/or forwarding any relevant e-mails to me so that I can help
     <br />
     Bernard bring Gregory up to speed next week?
     <br />
     <br />
     Thanks!
     <br />

  Just one thing to look out re dmfr and imaging. They had terrible content flow for many years, often leading to volumes being loaded in completely different years and totally out of order. In H1O we did some fudging to get them to show up correctly on the archive page. I'm not sure how that will look in H2O.

  DP: we're putting the archive under a/c in January. Can we
  <b>
   <font>
    do PDF extracts
   </font>
  </b>
  <font>
   ?
   <br />
   TM: Don't have any reason to believe it will be significant effort.
   <br />
   <br />
   CD: .... keeping using pivotal?
   <br />
   BH: yes for now, but we need to reorganize ongoing maintenance
   <br />
   <br />
   CD: Yes, frewer calls, development workflow, access to dev site, etc.
   <br />
   Yes, the whole aim was getting us to be more self-sufficient.
   <br />
   ===
   <br />
   CD: need figures for optimized mobile. Was talking to Jeremy and Louise our end, would do w/you?&nbsp; Jeremy would do design?
   <br />
   TM: our current mobile solution is tied to standard H2O site, which we no longer have. We can catalog places wehre there is a depdency, and ...
   <br />
   TM: We use Drupal for mobile sites, were our first. We have a major upgrade that kicks off early next year. Serving of content has ties to h2O.
   <br />
   Markup server serves amenable markup.&nbsp;&nbsp; So you *could* build mobile on top of your Drupal site.
   <br />
   <br />
   DB: Drupal &quot;mobile friendly template&quot; is one popular way to do this.
   <br />
   TM: Yes, a mobile theme in site is one way. Other school of thought is separate site.&nbsp; Startup site could be built quite easily.&nbsp; POP will be a challenge.
   <br />
   <br />
   DP: we need to strategize
   <br />
   <br />
   ===========
   <br />
   <br />
   CD: Issue w/site going down for 10-10:30am. for a couple of minutes.
   <br />
   TM: PH was working on this w/DBA yesterday, Not sure what came of that.
   <br />
   <br />
   CD: site was slow yesterday
   <br />
   DB: Google page speed was reporting slow. A spike.
   <br />
   TM: maybe in our release yesterday?&nbsp; Or maybe Bing hitting us?
   <br />
   ** [OR THE RBAC CACHE ISSUE]
   <br />
   <br />
   CD: OpenURL::: Broke yesterday???
   <br />
   TM: QB ticket re: some vendors trying to use vol/iss/page .
   <br />
   DB: all broken
   <br />
   <br />
   DB: File permission problems... we've set up an admin script doesn't fix one of the items.
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
   DB: Page optimization - page speed... Image carousels have big images...
   <br />
   <br />
   CD: logout from Athens still broken.
   <br />
   <br />
   DB: taxonomy not updating, about a week

In production this would be &quot;.bmj.com&quot;. You will want to change this (or remove it) for your sandboxes. For this reason I have not featurized it.

  <font>
   Gentlemen,
   <br />
   <br />
   A follow up to the security issue identified earlier in the evening:
   <br />
   In order for this bug to be exploited, a POST would have had to be
   <br />
   made to somewhere in
   <i>
    <font>
     /admin/
    </font>
   </i>
   <font>
    * . I've looked at the access logs since
    <br />
    launch and every POST to /admin falls into two categories:
    <br />
    <br />
    A. Coming from a recognized HighWire or BMJ IP address
    <br />
    B. Coming from an unrecognized IP address in London doing a lot really
    <br />
    boring work that fits exactly with the BMJ's workflow.
    <br />
    <br />
    So, as far as I can tell, this issue was not exploited. However, If
    <br />
    properly exploited by a knowledgeable person who managed to cover
    <br />
    their tracks (edit the apache access logs), access could be gained to
    <br />
    the netsite account on the Drupal web servers.
    <br />
    <br />
    Bug Details
    <br />
    ====================
    <br />
    <br />
    Access Control to the site is based upon three items: the identity
    <br />
    array (established from the backend AC service), a Drupal user object
    <br />
    (which provides drupal-level privileges), and a Drupal user node
    <br />
    (which stores additional metadata about the user).
    <br />
    <br />
    The normal flow for a user logging in is as follows:
    <br />
    <br />
    A known user:
    <br />
    <br />
    1. Identity is established from backend AC
    <br />
    2. A user-node is looked-up in the database, using the matching highwire user ID
    <br />
    3. The associated user object is loaded form the user-node and the
    <br />
    client is logged in as that user
    <br />
    <br />
    When a new user visits the site:
    <br />
    <br />
    1. Identity is established from backend AC
    <br />
    2. A user-node is created
    <br />
    3. A user-object is created and associated with the user-node
    <br />
    <br />
    The bug is that the user-object table only supports title lengths of 60 characters, but the user-node table supports titles of up to 255 characters (these are both drupal core tables). When the user-object is saved to the database it
    <b>
     <font>
      fails for identities who names are over 60 characters.
     </font>
    </b>
    <font>
     This results in the user-node having an empty user-id
     <br />
     associated with it. The
     <font>
      empty user-id then falls back to the default user-id,
      <font>
       which is uid=1 (the hwadmin user-id). This results in the user-node being falsely associated with the hwadmin user account.
      </font>

  <br />
  Dear all, I'm delighted to announce that the new bmj.com is live and kicking and is looking great. Do take a look if you haven't done so already.
  <br />
  <br />
  We have also redesigned (though less radically) the print journal, with the new layout in place for this week's issue (Nov 12).
  <br />
  <br />
  Both redesigns are the result of a sustained effort of commitment, expertise, creativity, team work, and late nights for many people in the&nbsp; BMJ, Technology, and Marketing.
  <br />
  <br />
  On the print redesign, special congratulations and thanks go to Trevor Jackson, who has led the redesign, to Jane Walker our wonderful designer, and to John Mayor and his fabulous production team Malcolm Brown, Jett Aislabie, and Adam Di Chiari.
  <br />
  <br />
  For bmj.com, particular congratulations and thanks go to David Payne and Ian Hopwood and their respective teams in the BMJ and Technology.
  <br />
  <br />
  David has led the project with enormous care, expertise, and diplomacy, and has been wonderfully supported throughout by Birte Twisselman, Juliet Dobson, Matthew Billingsley, and Kelly Brendel. Juliet is clearly a project manager in the making, after effortlessly managing the process of migrating the huge amount of content in BMJ Resources from one content management system to another. Thanks too to Duncan Jarvies and Harriet Vickers who successfully migrated three years' worth of podcasts and video over to the new site and produced a launch video at short notice.
  <br />
  <br />
  Ian's skillful management, with Peter, of our relations with Highwire has got us to a far better place than we could ever have expected a year ago, and his team has achieved superb delivery of the site. Special thanks go to Christina Davies who has project managed the redevelopment, and has been (everyone I speak to agrees with this) a dream to work with. Her championing of the agile process has been a particularly important contribution.
  <br />
  <br />
  Daniel Berhane and Xabier Maeztu have been the mainstays in Technology, working closely with Highwire and always managing to find solutions to the many technical challenges that the BMJ's redevelopment has posed. Jeremy Gillies and Amy Asante have created a wonderfully clean and stylish design, responding and adapting to feedback&nbsp; from users and input from the editorial team. As with the Learning launch they have established a strong BMJ Group look and feel that will benefit users of all our online products. Helen King used her encyclopaedic knowledge of the site and its underlying technology to make sure nothing fell though the cracks and that the BMA user journey and specialist portals worked as well as possible. Esther O'Sullivan too has been essential in ensuring that the specialist portals look great and in promoting doc2doc content on the site.
  <br />
  <br />
  On the marketing front, Geetha has been her usual unflappable and effective self, with support from Rachna, handling the pre and post launch promotion and ensuring that subscription and emails are now well promoted on the new site.
  <br />
  <br />
  So well done and thanks to everyone who has helped to make this next phase of the BMJ's development such a success. We are lucky to have such people in the group. Please do send any comments about the journal in print and online to Trevor and David.
  <br />
  <br />
  All best wishes, Fi
  <br />

    <br />
    Can I just add my sincere thanks to everyone. It really has been an absolutely tremendous effort.
    <br />
    For some of us this project started back in 2009 with extensive market research but it seemed to take us all 2010 to get this project really up and running which it certainly has been this year. Its been a brilliant piece of work and latterly a real team effort with Highwire. But I don't think I've ever run a project where I've had to change the suppliers management team before we really got things moving. But we got there in the end.
    <br />
    Very well done. Its a project we can all be proud of. And a platform we can build on - there's loads of things we want to do.
    <br />
    <br />
    And make sure you have several drinks on the BMJ tomorrow at 4.30.
    <br />
    <br />
    Ian Hopwood

                                                     Tried going in via My Athens and via HW login via Athens.
                                                     <br />
                                                     <br />
                                                     Journey is correct and url looks as if it is picking up Athens info but&nbsp; not actually giving acceess. (Could be my sub but think extra problem is that the string across top with user info not working)

  11:24 &lt;ToddMtg&gt; bernie, Eric says in order to get our MySQL slaves working we need to restart the BMJ prod database server
  <br />
  11:25 &lt;ToddMtg&gt; which will mean a 1-5 minute outage
  <br />
  11:26 &lt;ToddMtg&gt; so our question is whether we try to squeeze that in this afternoon or wait for Saturday maint
  <br />
  11:27 &lt;ToddMtg&gt; do you have an opinion?
  <br />
  ...
  <br />
  11:39 &lt;phayes&gt; ToddMtg, I think we should ask Eric to just fix MySQL now, regardless of downtime
  <br />
  11:39 &lt;phayes&gt; because we really should get all robots back in
  <br />
  11:40 &lt;ToddMtg&gt; I'm thinking like after 2:00 PM, Patrick
  <br />
  11:40 &lt;phayes&gt; ok sounds good
  <br />
  11:40 &lt;ToddMtg&gt; but I want Bernie to be on board with explaining to BMJ why we didn't clear a 1-5 minute downtime with them ahead of time
  <br />
  <br />
  11:50 &lt;bh&gt; todd, phayes, I'm going to send a note to Christina and david re: the down time
  <br />
  11:50 &lt;bh&gt; will the entire site be down, or just content access?
  <br />
  11:50 &lt;Todd&gt; all of it
  <br />
  11:51 &lt;bh&gt; for how long?
  <br />
  11:51 &lt;Todd&gt; 1-5 minutes
  <br />
  11:51 &lt;bh&gt; are we SURE?
  <br />
  11:51 &lt;Todd&gt; eric says he's SURE
  <br />
  11:52 &lt;bh&gt; Eric??&nbsp; Well, good enough for me!&nbsp; Composing note, will cc you both

  16:18 &lt;phayes&gt; still having weird issues with highwire users being associated with hwadmin
  <br />
  16:18 &lt;phayes&gt; no security implications
  <br />
  16:19 &lt;phayes&gt; but it looks bad
  <font>
   when you log-in as hwadmin
   <font>
    <br />
    16:19 &lt;bh&gt; oh, man, you're kidding?
    <br />
    16:19 &lt;phayes&gt; I wish I was
    <br />
    16:20 &lt;bh&gt; dangit!
    <br />
    16:22 &lt;bh&gt; so are random subscribers getting hwadmin access to content?
    <br />
    16:22 &lt;bh&gt; or is it just the auth string
    <br />
    16:24 &lt;phayes&gt; no
    <br />
    16:24 &lt;phayes&gt; The implication is as follows:
    <br />
    16:24 &lt;phayes&gt; 1. Yesterday they *would* have gotten hwadmin,
    <font>
     now it just fails and they can't log in
     <font>
      <br />
      16:24 &lt;phayes&gt; 2. The auth-string when you DO log in
      <font>
       as
       <b>
        <font>
         hwadmin
        </font>
       </b>
       <font>
        is wrong
        <font>
         <br />
         16:25 &lt;phayes&gt; There are two accounts this is happening to: Erfan Javaheri
         <br />
         16:25 &lt;phayes&gt; and John Bainton
         <br />
         16:25 &lt;phayes&gt; I can clean them up as they come in
         <br />
         16:25 &lt;bh&gt; who the hell are they?
         <br />
         16:25 &lt;phayes&gt; ??
         <br />
         16:26 &lt;bh&gt; Only two accounts? Shoot, I didn't even need to take my pills.
         <br />
         16:27 &lt;phayes&gt; Only two accounts..
         <br />
         16:27 &lt;phayes&gt; I've fixed these ones
         <br />
         16:27 &lt;phayes&gt; It seems that about a dozen accounts a day are affected
         <br />
         16:28 &lt;phayes&gt; I may put in a cron job to clean these up periodically, until we can find a real solution
         <br />
         16:28 &lt;bh&gt; That sounds like a jolly idea. Is the symptom that the user can't log in at all?
         <br />
         16:28 &lt;phayes&gt; yes
         <br />
         16:30 &lt;phayes&gt; Actually

 Michael, in connection with this point, I looked again at the small log excerpt I had saved from performing parallel activities on the old BMJ site and the drupal BMJ site, back on Nov 4. (similar activities to what I did on Nov 9) �From the old log,
  <font>
   the access method was logged as &quot;ip&quot; and a userid was logged for all of my log entries.
   <font>
    So, supporting what you say below about logging the AC info once it is established.�

 We'll have to talk to jim loucks about the guest issue. The other one is known and we are working on it.

    <br />
    The access control information looks incomplete to me. �As I discussed with Patrick,
    <font>
     once a user is known then the user_id and access_method should always be logged.
     <font>
      �I would think that all of these entries should have an ip access method and the Stanford subscription user_id.
      <br />
      <br />
      Also, 'guest' is being written as an access method and it should not be. �While I remember discussing this at one of our meetings, I can't remember if Jim L. was going to take care of not writing 'guest' when tab-delimited logs are created or if it was going to be omitted from the xml logs.
      <br />
      <br />

       I performed a set of activities / navigations in BMJ on November 9, documenting each step. Then compared that to the resulting entries in the tab-delimited service log, once that log was available (not available until Nov 12)
       <br />
       <br />
       Attached spreadsheet has further details. Tab 1 is the log entries for my IP address sorted by timestamp. Tab 2 is the same data but with 2 extra columns at the left. Column A notes issues/problems. Column B has the description of my online activities.
       <br />
       <br />
       This is from /archive/bmj/daily/dw_service.20111109.drupal.gz
       <br />
       <br />
       Baseline logging of abstracts, fulltext, PDFs, home page, data supplements, powerpoints appears to be ok, based on this small test. Once we have caught up with the daily BMJ parsing, we can gather high-level stats for these primary countable items, as another point of comparison between old and new application.
       <br />
       <br />
       Summary of issues I do see from this activity:
       <br />
       <br />
       1)
       <b>
        <font>
         Timestamps
        </font>
       </b>
       <font>
        are off from the actual time of the activity. For example I started at 1:57pm on Nov 9, corresponding log entries start 21:57
        <br />
        <br />
        2)
        <b>
         <font>
          Search
         </font>
        </b>
        <font>
         activity is not being logged in a way that will be counted as such, or will be counted incompletely. URIs have just &quot;/search?&quot;. We expect the string &quot;/search?&quot; followed by additional text (such as the search string). �For example, here is a URI from pre-drupal application that is counted as a search for usage stats:
         <br />
         �/search?fulltext=chocolate&amp;submit=yes&amp;x=0&amp;y=0
         <br />
         <br />
         3) Navigating through &quot;
         <b>
          <font>
           online archive
          </font>
         </b>
         <font>
          &quot; listings does not log as TOC views, while navigating through &quot;print archive&quot; listings does. Is this intentional and ok for BMJ stats?
          <br />
          <br />
          4) &quot;browse latest print issue TOC&quot; is logged as a TOC view, but not marked as
          <b>
           <font>
            &quot;current&quot; TOC,
           </font>
          </b>
          <font>
           so it looks like BMJ will get &quot;other TOC&quot; hits but no &quot;current TOC&quot; hits
           <br />
           <br />
           5) Several activities that should be logged and counted as
           <b>
            <font>
             feature/clickthrough
            </font>
           </b>
           <font>
            usage, for the new reports, are not being logged at all. May need discussion/analysis of which activities in the new application map to &quot;features&quot; or &quot;clickthrough activities&quot; in old application. �It looks like BMJs numbers on the new feature report will be very different; don't know how significant that will be to BMJ.
            <br />
            <br />
            a) The act of emailing a friend -- not logged
            <br />
            <br />
            b) The act of clicking the link in the email -- is logged simply as another FULL view, does not have ?eaf token so we recognize it as a &quot;clickthrough&quot; article view
            <br />
            <br />
            c) Could not see that clicking any social bookmarking link registered in the log.
            <br />
            <br />
            d) &quot;Citing articles via Scopus&quot; -- not logged
            <br />
            <br />
            e) &quot;Citing articles via Web of Science&quot; -- not logged. Note that clicking on &quot;web of science&quot; from a reference in an article does generate a log entry that will count as ISI feature usage. May need discussion whether both of these activities should count.
            <br />
            <br />
            f) &quot;Find similar articles in Pubmed&quot; -- not logged -- compare to Heart, where�&quot;PubMed citation&quot; link from an article view is logged as pubmed feature usage. Note that clicking on &quot;medline&quot; from a reference in an article does generate a log entry that will count as pubmed feature usage. May need discussion whether both of these activities should count.
            <br />
            <br />
            g) &quot;Reading responses&quot; is not being logged as eletter usage. May need discussion whether it should.
            <br />
            <br />
            h) None of my activities resulted in log entries that will count as RSS feature usage -- perhaps I missed the links corresponding to this.

  Re: [bmj-redesign] quick search (BMJPG)
  <br />
  This ended up being a larger fix than I thought, and uncovers some incorrect assumptions about the Solr search results in the results processing theme functions.
  <br />
  <br />
  In the function bmj_preprocess_search_result the variable $node is being copied from the array passed into it representing the search result, $vars['node'].
  <br />
  <br />
  This is not the fully-loaded node. Rather than load every node in a set of search results, the Solr module creates a facsimile of the node out of the fields in the search result. So since we indexed the node's title and body, those are included.
  <br />
  <br />
  However 'epubdate' and 'ppubdate' are not things included in the search index. So when the function tries to pass a variable 'pubdate' by getting it from the node's &quot;field_highwire_a_epubdate' the DateTime::__create() function is getting a NULL argument, and is thus creating a DateTime object with the current date. This is why all of the search results show a published date that is in the very recent past.
  <br />
  <br />
  I added a couple of small hooks to the BMJ Core module to handle this field's special behaviour.
  <br />
  <br />
  function bmj_core_apachesolr_update_index(&amp;$document, $node) {
  <br />
  �if (!empty($node-&gt;field_highwire_a_ppubdate)) {
  <br />
  <br />
  $d = new DateTime($node-&gt;field_highwire_a_ppubdate[0]['value'], new DateTimeZone('UTC'));
  <br />
  $formatted_date = $d-&gt;format('Y-m-d\TH:i:s\Z');
  <br />
  $document-&gt;created = $formatted_date;
  <br />
  $document-&gt;changed = $formatted_date;
  <br />
  �}
  <br />
  �
  <br />
  What I'm doing here is I'm replacing the Solr document's created and updated dates, which normally hold the Drupal node's created and updated dates, with the HighWire object's ppubdate. (If you would prefer this be the epubdate then you can change it there.)
  <br />
  <br />
  I also had to modify the search results template function to handle this date format.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Another problem I came across and fixed is that DOIs are not being stored in Solr. The theme template function seems to have a fundamental misunderstanding about where its &quot;$node&quot; variable is coming from. It's not a fully-loaded node, and thus doesn't have all the fields stored with the node. It only has fields that are stored in Solr - i.e., by default the title, node body, authors and other fields that contain numeric or ordinal values.
  <br />
  <br />
  Free-form text fields get indexed but not stored, since Drupal doesn't think they would make good facets (too many possible values.) Thus if we want to retrieve and display a value like the article DOI in Solr results, we need to explicitly store it at index time and ask for it at query time.
  <br />
  <br />
  Drupal has a dynamic field set up in its schema.xml so that you can add any text fields by simply writing them to the search document with the prefix &quot;ss_cck&quot; (ss stands for single string).
  <br />
  <br />
  In the bmj_core_apachesolr_update_index function I've added the following:
  <br />
  <br />
  �if (!empty($node-&gt;field_highwire_article_doi)) {
  <br />
  $document-&gt;ss_cck_field_highwire_article_doi = $node-&gt;field_highwire_article_doi[0]['value'];
  <br />
  �}
  <br />
  <br />
  Upon re-indexing, all nodes with this CCK field will have corresponding Solr documents with a field ss_cck_field_highwire_article_doi.
  <br />
  <br />
  This is sufficient for getting the values into the index, but when you query Solr it only returns the fields you've asked for. By default Drupal asks for standard things like Title, snippet, authors, etc. which the template function renders as expected.
  <br />
  <br />
  However, wee need to add to the query string we send to Solr whenever we make a search query to add this new custom field.
  <br />
  <br />
  I've added this function to bmj_core.module:
  <br />
  <br />
  function bmj_core_apachesolr_modify_query(&amp;$query, &amp;$params) {
  <br />
  �$params['fl'] .= ',ss_cck_field_highwire_article_doi';
  <br />
  }
  <br />
  <br />
  now the template function has another field it can display. �I've modified the bmj_preprocess_search_result function in the BMJ theme's template.php function.
  <br />
  <br />
  $vars['doi'] = $node-&gt;ss_cck_field_highwire_article_doi;
  <br />
  <br />
  Note that we explicitly send field_highwire_article_doi[0]['value'] to Solr, so when we read back the result we can just get the string.
  <br />
  <br />
  Similar fix required for Citation field
  <br />
  <br />
  There is an incorrect reference to the BMJ citation field in the same template.php file. Similarly to the DOI and Date fields, the field it is attempting to render is NULL, and therefore a default value is being created, BMJ 2011:0 for every result.
  <b>
   <font>
    �I don't have time to fix this for you now, but you can follow the same
   </font>
  </b>
  <font>
   store-and-query workflow to put this value into the Solr index and retrieve it at query time.
   <br />
   <br />
   Full re-index required
   <br />
   <br />
   Since we are modifying the search index to accomodate these fields, it will be necessary to delete the Solr index and do a full re-index. �Because we are adding new fields the index will be slightly larger, but that shouldn't cause any noticeable performance degradation.
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
   I hope this helps, it's definitely getting into the more advanced Solr manipulation and making the mistake of assuming you have all the fields in a node is an understandable one to make.
   <br />
   <br />
   Cheers,
   <br />
   <br />

   PS. I'll attach this note to a pull request I'm making that contains these fixes.

    Additionally, if say, I search for ovarian cancer and I click on the first article in the results, although
    <b>
     <font>
      it says published 25 October 2011 in the results it's actually published in 1852.
     </font>
    </b>
    <font>
     So maybe it is boosting for most recent content but there's just a bug in the date display for search results. Also when you actually go through to the article you get the following - this was working ok before in prod and seems to be an access control issue.

  <br />
  Couple of things have come up to do with press releases that we need to think about:
  <br />
  <br />
  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment, press releases are delivered to Highwire with the v-issue bundle as html files. One file per issue containing releases for multiple articles e.g. http://www.bmj.com/content/342/7797.press-release.html
  <br />
  <br />
  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks like these press releases are something special � not articles and not issue data supplements.&nbsp; Perhaps HW could explain how these work?
  <br />
  <br />
  Assuming the BMJ eds want to keep press releases I suggest we do the following:
  <br />
  <br />
  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For archive press releases we replicate what we do now in some way. We add the press releases to the print issue table of contents and don�t have any links to them from the article content box
  <br />
  <br />
  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For new press releases we change the workflow so that press releases are entered directly into Drupal and associated with an article. We stop creating html files and sending them with the v-issue bundle. This means the only copy of the press release file will be in Drupal (and with the press office) but this doesn�t strike me as a big deal � we don�t send press releases in this format to anyone.
  <br />
  <br />
  This is going to be a change of workflow and will probably mean that Brite/David/Juliet need to work on press releases again rather than Jett and Malcolm so this needs agreement from the BMJ team before we start doing anything.
  <br />

   db: There seems to be a cache issue with JSON input part of the feed2widget service. The JSON based widgets which display most read, shared, searched are not working properly and sometimes display blank panes. It looks like the caching work done by Cash Williams need a review.

  &quot;Still a few weird caching issues on speciality portal pages&quot;
  <br />
  <br />
  1. On multiple-sclerosis portal page, a lot of cardiology content was appearing until I manually cleared the cache then only 2 blocks of content still with cardiology content remained. I can't seemt o get rid of this
  <br />
  <br />
  2. there was a lot of cardiology content on the neurology page until I cleared the cache manually again then it all disappeared.
  <br />
  <br />
  3. Cardiology content appearing on onlcology page. Also, after trying to clear the cache to see if this disappeared, the journals content disappeared from the page. I then chcked back a bit later and it was back!

   It looks like this is a content uploading issue with topics on the prod site.&nbsp; Some topics are missing as we've found out by comparing the same article on dev01 and prod. For example the article below&nbsp; has Gastroenterology topic on dev01 but not prod site:

    Hi Patrick, the topic collection roll up seemed fine on dev01 but seems to still be problematic on production, displaying some very old content, just thought I'd flag this up

    This looks like an item for us. I'll be sure to get it done this wekend.

     I could find a problem on our implementation of topic views which may have caused this problem. It looks like HW taxonomy content issue. The BMJ topic view is working fine even on the dev01 site, but for some reason we do not know the correct views list is not displayed.

   There are two independent issues that are giving us problems.
   <br />
   <font>
    <br />
    1. The feeds service running-out of memory. This is fixed and the production site appears to have recovered.
    <br />
    <font>
     <br />
     2. The &quot;occasional&quot; missing topic-collections. This one is still being dealt with, but it looks like it's not a P1.

      Also, in Jim's first note, he says we don't have monitoring on the A4D services.
      <br />
      &quot;Come to think of it, I'm not aware of any monitoring scheme we have on
      <br />
      a4d either -- and that includes alerting on resources that keep
      <br />
      needing to get requeued due to failures.&quot;

      12:14 &lt;phayes&gt; MaybeSo, I know I asked you this before, but I forget the answer, so apologies. Question: On the
      <b>
       <font>
        feeds service,
       </font>
      </b>
      <font>
       if an article does not have any collections, do I get a 404 or an empty feed document?
       <br />
       ...
       <br />
       12:17 &lt;phayes&gt; OK, I'm
       <font>
        modifying our extract policy so that if the feeds service happens to be down or busy A4D re-queues it.
        <font>
         I just need to make sure that if an article doesn't have any collections, A4D doesn't mark it as an error and re-queue it forever and ever.
         <br />
         13:58 &lt;MaybeSo&gt; phayes: so... yes, you'll get a 404 if an article isn't a member of any collection
         <br />
         13:59 &lt;MaybeSo&gt; phayes: that's not &quot;an error&quot;, it's simply a statement of fact that the collection/collection-member resource is not found
         <br />
         13:59 &lt;MaybeSo&gt; the alternative is to stuff every single article we have in our database into the feeds service
         <br />
         13:59 &lt;MaybeSo&gt; which seems silly
         <br />
         14:00 &lt;phayes&gt; Hmmmmm
         <br />
         14:00 &lt;phayes&gt; THis is problematic
         <br />
         14:00 &lt;MaybeSo&gt; Why?
         <br />
         <font>
          14:00 &lt;phayes&gt; THere's no way for the extraction service to know if it should error, or skip
          <br />
          <font>
           14:01 &lt;MaybeSo&gt; it should skip on 404
           <br />
           <br />
           14:01 &lt;MaybeSo&gt; it's *not* an error
           <br />
           14:01 &lt;phayes&gt; It may not be an error, but it's a problem
           <br />
           14:01 &lt;phayes&gt; The problem is that there is
           <font>
            no way, as far as I know, in xpath
            <br />
            14:01 &lt;phayes&gt; to differentiate between a 404 and a 500
            <font>
             <br />
             14:01 &lt;MaybeSo&gt; do you not have access to http:get ?
             <br />
             14:02 &lt;phayes&gt; I'm still learning xpath, so maybe there is a way....
             <br />
             14:03 &lt;MaybeSo&gt; if you only have access to doc/doc-available you don't have any way to xpath it
             <br />
             14:03 &lt;MaybeSo&gt; we'd have to ask dmitri about returning a &quot;friendly&quot; xml status page that indicated the code
             <br />
             14:03 &lt;Matthias&gt; Jim's talking about some
             <font>
              Java-based XSLT extensions
              <font>
               we use for HTTP transactions, patrick
               <br />
               14:03 &lt;Matthias&gt; among other things, they let you check the HTTP response code.
               <br />
               14:04 &lt;Matthias&gt; you're right that it's not possible in unextended Xpath.
               <br />
               <font>
                14:04 &lt;phayes&gt; Is it possible to get something like this into the extract service?
                <font>
                 <br />
                 <br />
                 14:04 &lt;MaybeSo&gt; I assumed the extractor was hooked into Firenze, so I assumed you had access
                 <br />

   It looks like, to get nodewords working, I'll have to:
   <br />
   <br />
   1. Remove dependancies on nodewords from BMJ modules
   <br />
   2. Push this along with all our other changes to production
   <br />
   3. Uninstall nodewords on production
   <br />
   4. Commit and push the updated version to production
   <br />
   5. Enable the updated version on production
   <br />
   6. Roll this change (via DB dump) back to dev
   <br />
   <br />
   I've tested this and everything seems to be fine.&nbsp; Do I have your
   <br />
   permission to go ahead with the above?

 Hi Patrick
     <br />
     <br />
     We've just done some testing with Nodewords and have not yet started using it seriously. Please go ahead do re-installation/downgrading of Nodewords.
     <br />
     <br />
     Please let us know when this process is complete on the prod site so that Helen could starting doing SEO work for home, channel and taxonomy pages.
     <br />
     <br />
     regards,
     <br />
     Daniel.

       <br />
       <br />
       <br />
       <br />
       Hi folks,
       <br />
       <br />
       A message from our illustrious comrade from Aquia:
       <br />
       <br />
       Due to
       <font>
        performance issues found with Nodewords, and the lack of
        <br />
        support for the current version
        <font>
         (See http://drupal.org/node/1146230),
         <br />
         I reccommend a downgrade from 1.12 to 1.x-dev.
         <br />
         <br />
         Downgrading will cause a loss of all existing manually-defined meta
         <br />
         tags. We need to make sure BMJ doesn't have any non-standard meta tags
         <br />
         defined, or using any api calls unsupported by 1.x-dev.
         <br />
         <br />
         Can you confirm downgrading won't break any custom BMJ meta tags?

  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. very rare, in historical content, another fixed, bu that's a priority 2. news &amp; views - newer content. &quot;More...&quot; PH: will be flushed

    ==============
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    LAUNCH PROCEDURES
    <br />
    - would like to switch at 4pm . BMJT will come in latr and stay later.
    <br />
    - how to handle urgent matters (escalation), including on Wednesday (while we sleep)
    <br />
    - Then when is our next &quot;urgent but not critical&quot; release. Regular release 2 weeks later
    <br />
    <br />
    TM:
    <br />
    1. we need to keep existing h20 site - a copy - at another private URL
    <br />
    2. verifying monitoring on new drupal site, hooked to Nagios
    <br />
    3. on launch day, we'll be moving IP address. Or move the URL. The latter is easier, but it might take some number of hours to propagate. IP is immediate.
    <br />
    4. bmj.com h20 must come down first.
    <br />
    5. we'll have a war room.&nbsp;&nbsp; And we will have a conference line open with you.&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll confirm in real tme&nbsp; you can see the site, on your net, and elsewhere.
    <br />
    <br />
    That's the first two hours.
    <br />
    <br />
    What about issues?
    <br />
    6. We'll give you pager number on Todd's belt
    <br />
    7. We'll also have staff on stand-by
    <br />
    <br />
    TM: I advise we turn off downstream, which send out downstream alerts, etc,, until we verify they're working right, etc.
    <br />
    <br />
    TM: ROLLBACK. First hour or two is the danger period.&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll be monitoring the health of the site, and whether users are errroring.&nbsp; Moving the IP address means we simply move it back to the original site.
    <br />
    <br />
    CD: Rapid responses....
    <br />
    TM: worth suspending downstream alerts helps.
    <br />
    <br />
    CD: We had talked about
    <br />
    TM: We can probably remove the &quot;SUBMIT&quot; link&nbsp; Say, COB friday UK time.
    <br />
    DP: Monday would be better!
    <br />
    CD: Yeah, Monday COB GMT
    <br />
    <br />
    TM: another caution with ROLLBACK: Google might index us very quickly on the new site, and then if we rollback...
    <br />
    So for 24 hours, (or so), we keep bots good.
    <br />
    <br />
    IF we do rollback, there will be confusion in the logs. We'll have some&nbsp; on one host, and some on another. ...
    <br />
    <br />
    THRU DAY ONE
    <br />
    TM: Then we would let HK, or others, review the alerts on hold in Dominos. If there are OK, off thehy go.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    STEER COMM tomorrow
    <br />
    Will be able launch plan
    <br />
    * check-in
    <br />
    * escalation
    <br />
    * rollout / follow=up

           I've not set up a CNAME. Our convention is usually to do so and that convention
           <br />
           would dictate a name of eso-cdn.www.bmj.com. You might like to ask your
           <br />
           sysadmins, Patrick, to add such a CNAME to the bmj.com zone (specifically:
           <br />
           <br />
           � �eso-cdn.www.bmj.com. � � � � � � � � IN � � � � � � � � CNAME � � � � � � � � wac.1EFD.edgecastcdn.net.
           <br />
           <br />
           ) and I'll set that up in Edgecast.
           <br />

           Please address any queries to me.

           &gt; I am forwarding a request for you �from HighWire in regard to setting up
           <br />
           &gt; base-url CDN set-up.
           <br />
           &gt;
           <br />
           &gt; Highwire are proposing we use CDN (Edgcast) to serve static assets such as
           <br />
           &gt; JavaScript, CSS, and images for the new bmj.com Drupal site.
           <br />

   <br />
   then ask BMJ if they're still using them, and send a sample when available from Loucks.
   <br />
   Fields will be similar, but flow and architecture of site is different.

     <br />
     Escalation Procedures:
     <br />
     We perceive three phases of post-launch escalation
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First 2 hours after Launch - Escalation will be handled by telephone and pager. We will leave the conference line open and have it staffed during the first hours after launch. Escalation will be handled by BMJ and HW working jointly, BMJ will have the final call on the rollback plan.
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. First 24 hours - Escalation will be by pager (Todd's cell phone) and email Todd will be available for triage and escalation. A backup cell number will be provided in case Todd is unreachable, 911@highwire.stanford.edu will be tertiary support
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. After 24 hours - Escalation will revert to email and normal 911@highwire.stanford.edu service with Todd's cell phone serving as a third line of support
     <br />
     <br />
     Escalation options include:
     <br />
     1. Emergency fixes
     <br />
     2. Rollback
     <br />
     3. Scheduled upgrade
     <br />
     <br />
     Emergency fixes
     <br />
     Quick emergency fixes will be considered for P1 bugs for which very safe fixes can be made and for which testing can be completed rapidly.
     <br />
     <br />
     Rollback
     <br />
     Rollback will be an option available to BMJ in case P1 bugs of sufficient import are reported post-launch and for which a quick fix is not feasible. The rollback plan for the site has been tested, along with the launch process. If a rollback is deemed necessary we will move the BMJ IP from the Drupal site (F5) back to the H20 Varnish host and will then restart and unpause the H20 apache process for the BMJ site. At that point we would put back the password protection on the Drupal site. The collateral damage of such a rollback would be any Rapid Responses that were published while the Drupal site was live.
     <br />
     <br />
     Scheduled upgrade
     <br />
     Scheduled upgrades will be scheduled for P2 bugs of great importance. We will plan a rollout of post launch fixes for Thursday 11/10/2011 and a second rollout for 11/15/2011. HW and BMJ will jointly agree on a schedule for regular rollouts after this phase as well as planning for a 1.1 release and subsequent upgrade plans.

   <font>
    <br />
    * views improvements - ok?
    <br />
    * Alert linkouts?
    <br />
    * relative vs absolute references in CDN-based resources?

    <br />
    OTHER ISSUES:
    <br />
    <br />
    * release 1.x
    <br />
    <br />
    * working together after launch - efficiency for the long term.
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - bundled requests

    CD: FI is adamant our press release go out on Tuesday.
    <br />
    TM: loading HWX... during the launch process, content loading should pause.
    <br />
    CD: Normally they do batch load in morning, and one in afternoon.&nbsp; We'll do as much as we can in the morning, but it's a print batch day.&nbsp; So that's a critical day for TechEd's.&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll gap 3pm gmt and 5pm gmt

                  </font>
                 </b>
                 <font>
                  <br />
                  We perceive three phases of post-launch escalation
                  <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First 2 hours after Launch - Escalation will be handled by telephone and pager. We will leave the conference line open and have it staffed during the first hours after launch. Escalation will be handled by BMJ and HW working jointly, BMJ will have the final call on the rollback plan.
                  <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. First 24 hours - Escalation will be by pager (Todd's cell phone) and email Todd will be available for triage and escalation. A backup cell number will be provided in case Todd is unreachable, 911@highwire.stanford.edu will be tertiary support
                  <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. After 24 hours - Escalation will revert to email and normal 911@highwire.stanford.edu service with Todd's cell phone serving as a third line of support
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Escalation options include:
                  <br />
                  1. Emergency fixes
                  <br />
                  2. Rollback
                  <br />
                  3. Scheduled upgrade
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Emergency fixes
                  <br />
                  Quick emergency fixes will be considered for P1 bugs for which very safe fixes can be made and for which testing can be completed rapidly.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Rollback
                  <br />
                  Rollback will be an option available to BMJ in case P1 bugs of sufficient import are reported post-launch and for which a quick fix is not feasible. The rollback plan for the site has been tested, along with the launch process. If a rollback is deemed necessary we will move the BMJ IP from the Drupal site (F5) back to the H20 Varnish host and will then restart and unpause the H20 apache process for the BMJ site. At that point we would put back the password protection on the Drupal site. The collateral damage of such a rollback would be any Rapid Responses that were published while the Drupal site was live.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Scheduled upgrade
                  <br />
                  Scheduled upgrades will be scheduled for P2 bugs of great importance. We will plan a rollout of post launch fixes for Thursday 11/10/2011 and a second rollout for 11/15/2011. HW and BMJ will jointly agree on a schedule for regular rollouts after this phase as well as planning for a 1.1 release and subsequent upgrade plans.

         - 27 Oct�, �Still a few weird caching issues on speciality portal pages,� and&nbsp; �More specialty portal caching issues� items are fixed, we believe. The problems were caused by a bug in ctools and were not related to the caching that HighWire put in place.&nbsp; We suspect the home page oddities described by the BMJT team today are similarly attributable, so we should monitor to see if that pans out.
         <br />
         TM: Caveat here is in testing and assuring completeness. Includes home page (panels code patch; sent back to Drupal.org). We dont' know if ti was solely responsible.

  <br />
  CD: thank you so much for all the hard work.

  Challenge page: can't test from machine at BMJ, it keeps coming up with Lane med library. Known.
  <br />
  PH: I have a good idea of what it is.
  <br />

  CD: CACHING is a major problem, primary concern. Seems to be unstable, and then they come back. exl, the Archive one
  <br />
  <br />
  Key outstanding concern.
  <br />
  <br />
  PH: entire pane caching config, slightly unstable. Now we're only doing bug fixes to the existing caching.
  <br />
  IH: how to we have to review caching? do we have to review every page?
  <br />
  CD: We still might find stuff.&nbsp; Ballar is going through site vigorously.&nbsp; I would think we would've flushed them out.
  <br />
  CD: My concern is that archive switching to having this bug an hour ago.
  <br />
  PH: probably, there's a collision between pane IDs. Someone clicked on a page a hour before, that overwrote a cache....&nbsp; Caches are constantly being regenerated. We're trying to be efficient.
  <br />
  IH: When can we say &quot;we're done testing?&quot;

   I thought it would be useful to summarise where I think we are and what remains to be done in the next few days:
   <font>
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>
     <font>
      1. Outstanding items
     </font>
    </b>
    <font>
     requested to be fixed before code considered complete for performance testing (please find updated spreadsheet attached)
     <font>
      <br />
      <font>
       We have fixed most of these plus deferred some to be fixed post launch, the only two remaining are:
       <font>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>
         <font>
          a. change views to handle short titles
          <font>
          </font>
         </font>
        </b>
        <font>
         - awaiting instructions where to locate short titles in Drupal.
         <font>
          <br />
          <b>
           <font>
            b. search within channel
           </font>
          </b>
          <font>
           - we think this is a really simple thing to fix as currently this is implemented on fast search for the current live site - on the live site if you search in a channel page you get this option in the url:
           <font>
            <font>
             flag=channel_education
             <font>
              <font>
               it searches across all the relevant content within the education channel. Xabier has tried implementing this on the new site with the same option but it isn't working, we need to know what we should be inserting instead of this, we are presuming that as it is already implementing in fast and we are using fast for the channel searches it should be an easy fix. Maybe Alex can look at this and let us know if otherwise.
               <font>
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>
                 <font>
                  2. Currently we cannot view content in dev 01
                 </font>
                </b>
                <font>
                 - this impacts testing search but I think we can live with this for now as the
                 <b>
                  <font>
                   priority is getting the production site ready
                  </font>
                 </b>
                 <font>
                  and we don't want to distract Patrick from this. Xabier and Daniel have done some investigation in response to Patrick's note but I think we'll need to do some further joint work on this to resolve, maybe this can wait til next week.
                  <font>

                    - Roger did a final fix for this on Friday when he left, he ran a simulation on his sandbox which was supposed to reflect latest taxonomy changes by Patrick and confirmed it worked fine but we can't test on dev01 yet due to missing content issue �- we'll need to wait until production site is ready to test

                        , Patrick is working hard on this and hopefully we'll have this tomorrow am ready for us to start working on final content changes early next week.

                         <br />
                         <font>
                          I think that's it at this stage but just to reiterate our awareness of everyone's efforts both HighWire and BMJT, in trying to get this site finished. What we are trying to accomplish here is certainly not easy but I hope we can all focus on pushing through these issues to end up with a great site that reflects our positive collaboration!

  <br />
  <br />
  Dear all,
  <br />
  I wanted to pull together the themes for our call tomorrow, and suggest some rhetorical approaches.
  <br />
  <br />
  1. Status
  <br />
  BMJ's current stated top priorities are
  <br />
  <br />
  a) the &quot;short title&quot; development item, needed before code complete (BMJ; HW's part is done)
  <br />
  b) the desire for HW to get the production site up (at which point their editorial staff can start loading the non-article content.)�� (HW)
  <br />
  c) the &quot;search within channel&quot; development item, needed before code complete (HW;� then BMJ has styling to do)
  <br />
  d) dev01 content update� (HW)
  <br />
  e) other bugs and tweaks (BMJ)
  <br />
  <br />
  HighWire's priorities are to do whatever is needed to get to code completion, and to continue to build out the production site.
  <br />
  <br />
  2. Prospects
  <br />
  The two items needed for code completeness are not� large. BMJ will probably complete the &quot;short title&quot; item very quickly. The &quot;search within channel&quot; item requires HW (Patrick H) work, but the production server build has higher priority, and is also his task.
  <br />
  <br />
  I would guess that all three items will be complete early next week.
  <br />
  <br />
  3. Rhetoric
  <br />
  I expect all Ian cares about at the moment is the schedule. According to the original schedule:
  <br />
  ��� * code complete on 21 September would have yielded a launch on 1 November.�� So
  <br />
  ��� * code complete on 28 September� would have yielded a launch on� 8 November
  <br />
  ��� * code complete on 5 October would yield a 15 November launch
  <br />
  <br />
  I expect Ian to open loudly with November 1 as his opening negotiating position.� � Themes from his note to Tom yesterday, with responses:
  <br />

   1 making things happen in parallel
   <br />
   ��� Response: We're doing as much in parallel as we can now.
   <br />
   <br />
   2 there is a &quot;ton of code that can be thoroughly tested now&quot;
   <br />
   ��� Response: There has indeed been some testing going on. But there's no point in doing performance testing while, ex., coding of views isn't finalized
   <br />
   <br />
   3 work needed on rapid responses is &quot;self-contained&quot; and can be pursed in isolation, and merged back in later
   <br />
   ��� Fortunately, this seems to now be a non-issue, as the substantive bugs are fixed, and the others demoted in urgency
   <br />
   <br />
   4 the remaining functional items are &quot;small&quot;
   <br />
   ��� &quot;Small&quot; can still have an impact, in the same way a small carburetor adjustment would make a previous dynamometer reading much less relevant
   <br />
   <font>
    <br />
    I think our best hope of making a dent in his diatribes is to provide him with a more concrete understanding of the work we have left to do.� I spoke with Todd, and an example block schedule through performance testing, the critical path, follows:
    <br />
    <br />
    1) get to code complete on 5 October. Begin next stage of local performance testing
    <br />
    2) Acquia engagement #1, infrastructure assessment and planning: 10 October - 14 October
    <br />
    3) Acquia engagement #2 (with SOASTA), performance testing and tuning: 17 October - 28 October
    <br />
    4) implement performance tuning recommendations 31 October - 4 November
    <br />
    <br />
    That's
    <i>
     <font>
      only
     </font>
    </i>
    <font>
     the consultant engagement. We'll have other work, such as code update planning, site rollback� planning, bug fixes and so forth.� And it assumes that a week is enough to implement the performance recommendations.
     <br />
     <br />
     That's my take at the moment. Eager to hear from others.

   The very high level overview of the testing schedule is in Bernie's note below. I don't think you want to see the details of everything we're testing but if you do I can provide the detailed list as well.&nbsp; The milestones as they now stand are:
   <br />
   <font>
    <br />
    September 30, begin SOASTA Testing of production site&nbsp; infrastructure(was supposed to be Sept 22)
    <br />
    Oct 3 - October 6&nbsp;&nbsp; SOASTA Testing of full production site
    <br />
    October 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click-through testing of production site begins with Musikaar
    <br />
    October 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Begin engagement with Acquia to do infrastructure assessment and code review.
    <br />
    October 10-14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Test procedure for making change in dev, move to production (requires publisher interaction)
    <br />
    October 10 - 14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acquia is at HighWire assisting with infrastructure assessment, code review, load testing
    <br />
    October 17-21, 24-28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acquia is at HighWire assisting with performance testing, tuning
    <br />
    October 24-28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Defining and testing the site launch protocol and rollback plans
    <b>
     <font>
      <br />
      October 24-28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Making changes as identified in Acquia engagement
     </font>
    </b>
    <font>
     <br />
     Oct 31 -&nbsp; Nov 4&nbsp; &quot;Productionalizing&quot; site with monitors, backups, etc
     <br />
     <br />
     <font>
      <br />
      During last two weeks we would expect to observe the real-time publishing cycle as new content was loaded, embargoed,&nbsp; published and released on the site. We also have to plan for bugfixes for things that are identified in the testing, along with code and infrastructure changes as identified through our assessments. We need to make sure that backups are in place and usable. We need escalation procedures finalized for when things go bump in the night. We need site monitors in place on all infrastructure pieces as well as monitors on the&nbsp; key pages of the site and those monitors need to be break-tested.
      <br />
      <br />
      As you can see the testing schedule as it now stands takes us right down to the day before Nov 1, when we would begin making final launch preparations. It's incredibly aggressive , bordering on irresponsible, to think that we could get all of the post-test&nbsp; stuff done in the one day after testing and before Nov 1. We really need that last week to handle the last minute things that always come up in testing and assessment (always at the last minute). Actually having only a week makes me feel a bit &quot;squeezed&quot; to be honest but I can't objectively say we need more time.

  3 items we think must go in before code complete
  <br />
  34 items are ok to do after code complete

  <br />
  2 items� need additional triage from BMJ before we have any idea how to classify

   And we're holding to our original CC date of 9/20?&nbsp; At this point of the

    I'm not suggesting that we say no to
    <br />
    everything

      &quot;change requested&quot;
      <font>
       into the
       <br />
       &quot;first&quot; release of the site, it needs to specify what the &quot;change&quot; is, why
       <br />
       is it being requested, what is the total time/cost to design, code, test,
       <br />
       regression test that change and what the effect is on the milestone/release
       <br />

          No, this is NOT Agile.&nbsp; You're right.&nbsp; It's already been made clear that

          this isn't a pure Agile development by Ian, while many of the engineering
          <br />
          practices are Agile, clearly there are aspects of Waterfall in it. So what's
          <br />
          the cost been to add those &quot;few items in the last couple of weeks&quot;?
          <br />
          Engineering effort?&nbsp; Certainly not free.&nbsp; Obviously we can't control what
          <br />
          they're doing, but we also can't let our customers control how we develop
          <br />
          products.&nbsp; At the end of the day, they WILL hold us accountable and we'll
          <br />
          all be sitting around w/our mouths open.&nbsp; If we add things to their plate,
          <br />
          they have the &quot;right&quot; to request change control approval.&nbsp; This is only
          <br />
          going to bite us if/when our side screws up, we won't know when they screw
          <br />
          up.&nbsp; That's ok, they have their management to account to.

  New Hires
  <br />
  PH: Alex should be on bmj work next week
  <br />
  New developer June 13...
  <br />
  Plus other Drupal resources whose time will be freed up.
  <br />
  <br />
  * Embargo
  <br />
  When can we start testing that... When Flag??
  <br />
  TM: requires A4D. So another couple of weeks.
  <br />
  Niz: A4D hitting targets internally
  <br />
  <br />
  * Access Control
  <br />
  Niz:&nbsp; must do it right, and not expedient
  <br />
  Ian: are we happy that we'll be able to cover a/c
  <br />
  Niz: we have ways of trying about a dozen different use cases...
  <br />
  Testing still needs to be specified, to simulate each case.&nbsp;&nbsp; Test harnass...
  <br />
  <br />
  IH: do we have all the use cases enumerate
  <br />
  TM: we're asking our a/c folks to inventory, andn we'll be testing. We'll test all the models are
  <br />
  <br />
  CD: concerns
  <br />
  1) authentication
  <br />
  2) disagree about problem with #s of items
  <br />
  3) enumerate from preview site
  <br />
  <font>
   <br />
   CD: Start challenge page?
   <br />
   PH: could present at drupal level the API, without the backend. But a lot of it &quot;would be empty... a lot of the pieces won't be there yet. But we can work on the Drupal API..&nbsp;&nbsp; We can test indiv and inst username/password.&quot;
   <br />
   <font>
    <br />
    each possible login type, will be presented as a ctools content type. So the login page is constructing a minipanel, with a variety of different panes, each pane is a way to log in.&nbsp; Those panes might not show up i the method is not available.
    <br />
    I can start building out those panes. I could stub some html, too.
    <br />
    Niz: Like what we did for embargo, prior to a4d.
    <br />
    PH: then, how to deal with all the pieces will be big; institutional branding, auth string, etc.
    <br />
    <br />
    ============================
    <br />
    <br />
    BH: RESOURCING PROBLEM!
    <br />
    <br />
    PH: #1 concern is login page
    <br />
    Niz: we need same focus we had for a4d.
    <br />
    <br />
    PH: Plan B is to proxy the H2O login page.
    <br />
    <br />
    - video
    <br />
    - cited reference links
    <br />
    <br />
    Niz: Kangmin does interface
    <br />
    Aelx is peer of PH, coming up to speed.
    <br />
    PH: Yes, he'll be doing more medium level stuff.
    <br />
    <br />
    Niz: asco will require monitoring
    <br />
    PH: and we have a &quot;post-launch backlog.
    <br />
    <br />
    Othe projects:
    <br />
    * need to move to production infra
    <br />
    * need to do mobile launches
    <br />
    <br />
    Niz: so we need to

    1) talk to TOdd
    <br />
    2) status a4d

               Niz: we could take, ex., 50%/100%/150% of load, and see if we get a linear curve. If so, we're good.&nbsp; If not, we probably have a bottleneck somewhere.

    <font>
     <br />
     <font>
      Testing is planned to be done by HighWire Developers as part of dev testing and an outsourced QA engineer.
      <br />
      Testing is planned to be done using manual testing with
      <i>
       <font>
        HighWire browser
       </font>
      </i>
      <font>
       , automated error checking for content loads, and unit tests with simpletest framework. Later for regression purposes Selenium based automation will be created.
       <font>

        PREVIOUS:
        <br />

         PH simpletest:&nbsp; interface for testing the code. Basically pseudo-unit testing.
         <br />
         Musikaar will be writing to that interface.&nbsp; Still in process of setting them up.
         <br />
         types of test for Musikaar
         <br />
         1. content sanity checking
         <br />
         ex. run through complete content load logs, look for missing links (ex., correction)
         <br />
         2. Check for errors in content logs.
         <br />
         3. crawling web site for errors
         <br />
         4. database testing. There's a query log to check against bad behavior
         <br />
         5. Unit test via Simpletest
         <br />
         take core classes, and assert what inputs should result in which outputs.&nbsp; HW developers would define key API functions.

           &nbsp;&nbsp; Unit tests belong to Dev.
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp; What is content completeness? Content does not change and content is owned/delivered by BMJ.
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp; We provide complete interfaces to all stored content and it is up to them to display in desired format to the desired level. So content QA belongs to then. Unless this is specified as a joint responsibility and some money is agreed upon for payment. Do you have a copy of the BMJ Redesign work scope agreement between BMJ and HighWire? If the work scope contains specific deliverable QA tasks, then we have to do. Before you started working Bernard called for meeting and Jim has echoed that QA does not have to do much.
           <br />
           <br />
           Today's meeting is initiated by Patrick and is on Drupal work for ASCO and BMJ Redesign. Patrick has some ideas and since ASCO is due very shortly, along with Todd he wanted to talk about that. Once ASCO plan is clearer, we can talk about BMJ. Perhaps early next week you can schedule meeting with Todd, Patrick, me, you and Bernard specifically for BMJ.

  1. CD: good progress .&nbsp; Need to hit about 50 points per week
  <br />
  CD we will have prioritization meeting next week.
  <br />
  I: 340 pts, remaining in this release; 12 pts per iteration;&nbsp; &quot;seroiusly ramping up&quot;.&nbsp; What can we realistically achieve? We now have 3 developers working on this.&nbsp; In ideal world, we could do 30 points from our end.
  <br />
  <br />
  Niz: Drupal team is 3 people. PH is base code line, and custom bmjpg stuff. He works w/our other team, a/c
  <br />
  2.5 weeks to alex, we're ramping him up before he gets here.
  <br />
  <br />
  IH: that's good to hear, Jim.&nbsp; Can we hit 50 points in each 2 week iteration.
  <br />
  <br />
  Niz: NEED TO GET TWO TEAMS TOGETHER.
  <br />
  ... concerned that we have things to do that might slow you down..
  <br />
  I need to see a couple more iterations to make sure that we've turned the page reliably.
  <br />
  <br />
  IH: Let's set 50 at a target, and review with that in mind. July or something completion date. But we should monitor carefully.
  <br />

    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * authorization
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * authentication
    <br />
    <font>
     PH: Authorization is in the bag, our a/c team is said to concur.
     <br />
     <br />
     Authentication not done. Only IP, Referrer-based work.
     <br />
     Anything that requires direct user input remains to be started.
     <br />
     Some large issues await [not sure what these are]

       3. Approach to other key features - search, handling embargoed content, url handling etc

                      We'll keep the pressure on, but we don't need this immediately.

  - a/c progress
  <br />
  PH: just marked authorization as complete (!!!!!!) TESTING STILL TO DO. according to a/c folks we're hitting all the use cases.&nbsp; Surprisingly easy. It's passing all the info you know to a/c serve, and parsing the result. The trick is being able to set that info (AuthN)
  <br />
  <br />
  cookies, IP, HTTP headers, URL query parameters are being handled in authN
  <br />
  <br />
  Authentication is entirely different story
  <br />
  IP and referring URLs are the only things that work out of the box.&nbsp; We get those from user without any USER INTERACTION. (athens, shib, guest, member:
  <b>
   <font>
    authN
   </font>
  </b>
  <font>
   work needed)
   <br />
   <br />
   &quot;2nd piece (authN) is bigger and harder, and we've started on it. &quot;
   <br />
   &quot;Several orders of magnitude.&quot; 2-4x.&nbsp; We both have conceptual work to do, and fussy bit building.
   <br />
   <br />
   ===
   <br />
   <br />
   - testing: functional (simpletest)
   <br />
   data only?
   <br />
   simpletest is for testing the code, to make sur eit makes sense from a code perspective.
   <br />
   Doesn't functional test &quot;can the user see a Rapids, or sorta&nbsp; Rapids, etc&quot;.
   <br />
   It's basically pseudo-unit testing.
   <br />
   Musikaar is writing to that interface.&nbsp; Still in process of setting them up.
   <br />
   Rama and PH are interfacing.
   <br />
   <br />
   PH: types of test for Musikaar
   <br />
   1. content sanity checking
   <br />
   ex. run through complete content load, look for missing links (ex., correction)
   <br />
   Our code logs everything. So it's log checking.
   <br />
   We'll start them there
   <br />
   2. Check for errors in same logs.
   <br />
   3. crawling web site for errors
   <br />
   4. database testing. There's a query log to check against bad behavior
   <br />
   <br />
   Load - hammer - check.
   <br />
   After that..
   <br />
   5. Unit test / via Simpletest
   <br />
   take coure classes, and assert what inputs should result in which outputs.&nbsp; HW developers would define key API functions.
   <br />
   <br />
   6. Functional testing
   <br />
   Pivotal tracker, check user stories. Ex., user can sort rapids responses...
   <br />
   <br />
   PH supports functional testing in iteration
   <br />
   <br />
   - performance
   <br />
   <br />
   PH: only heard re: beta release
   <br />
   We've talked about scaling
   <br />
   May even be able to use Varnish to aim traffic at drupal test install
   <br />

   PH: Hiring in limbo. Looked positive Justin, still weighing his options.
   <br />
   PH: Alex is onboard, just waiting&nbsp; - could start within the moth.

  RG
 Rama and I had a conversation around QA for BMJ.&nbsp; QA should be a part of the development of every User Story but I'm not sure this is happening today.&nbsp; This is the source of my Definition of Done recommendation for the steering committee.
  <br />
  <br />
  In previous Agile work we found it challenging to get the stakeholders to define exactly what criteria were needed to declare a given story as &quot;done&quot;.&nbsp; If you can't measure it, how do you know if it's done?&nbsp; We implemented a process policy that required documented test cases be attached to each story before they were eligible for development.&nbsp; The programmers/QA were then tasked with creating automated tests that implemented each test case.&nbsp; Only after failing tests were added to the daily build/test could actual User Story programming begin.&nbsp; This ensured that all stories had documented, automated, verifiable test cases that could be demonstrated to certify a story as &quot;done&quot;.
  <br />
  <br />
  I get the impression that we are sometimes 'schedule driven' and striving for speed.&nbsp; I think our focus should be 'quality driven' which will ultimately bring greater speed, but speed can't be the focus.&nbsp; It's a bit curious that we don't invite QA to the daily standup meetings, they are part of the development team and should be actively engaged in every iteration.

  TESTING:
  <br />
  <br />
  <font>
   Team,
   <br />
   Some preliminary text for item #4 on the agenda:
   <br />
   <b>
    <font>
     Functional Testing
     <br />
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    - HighWire will evaluate and implement an automated testing framework around the data services created for Drupal consumption
    <br />
    <i>
     <font>
      [Patrick] - Are there Drupal modules available that support automated test frameworks for Drupal modules?
      <br />
      <font>
       <a href="http://drupal.org/simpletest">
        http://drupal.org/simpletest
       </a>
       <br />
       PH: Yes, we will be using the simpletest module: http://drupal.org/project/simpletest
       <br />
      </font>
     </font>
    </i>
    <font>
     <br />
     - HighWire will work with BMJT to formulate Test Cases from the project Features to be implemented in the test framework
     <br />
     - HighWire and BJMT will consider the creation of Test Cases for future Feature development earlier in the iteration planning process
     <br />
     <br />
     Performance Testing
     <br />
     - HighWire and BMJT might consider a sub-team charged with evaluating and defining criteria around performance testing
     <br />
     - The large number of variables and scenarios could make all-points testing impractical, sub-team would document and present performance approaches that provide coverage of critical scenarios as efficiently as possible
     <br />
     <br />
     This gives a few points on which to begin a conversation with BMJT. �Please feel free to edit and adjust as appropriate. �I'll be available at TBH Wednesday morning at 7:30. �Thanks, Rich.

  DISCUSS...
  <br />
  1. PH can't&nbsp; go to UK, yet
  <br />
  2. offer the date, and TELL CD that we're preparing briefing documents.
  <br />
  3. express concern that HK isn't there
  <br />
  4. say our attendees will be: kfr, Niz, LP, BH, RG, PH
  <br />
  <br />
  ======
  <br />
  <br />
  LP: document welcome.
  <br />
  <br />
  RG: My charts only show which items are estimated. So after Release 1, not much is estimated
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  0, 30, 9, 9, 3. avg 10.2 (or 12 by Pivotal Tracker)
  <br />
  <br />
  We're goign to add one developer here in the next month (start May), so that doesn't help much.
  <br />
  <br />
  HK: could see a world where you're doing much better.
  <br />
  <br />
  PH: feels like we're doing good, but we're doing so much.
  <br />
  <br />
  BH 47 points in current sprint
  <br />
  <br />
  LP: we could
  <br />
  <br />
  CHANGES:
  <br />
  <font>
   1. increase probably from Xavier
   <br />
   2. natural increase as fundamentals continue to get done
   <br />
   3. HW gets additional staffer, but not 'til early May
   <font>
    <br />
    4. Can they do a &quot;public beta&quot; (different word)&nbsp; with less than complete feature set (i.e., missing some legacy features)
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * public preview...
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * general look and feel, article display, channel pages
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * performance/reliability
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * no rapids
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; a/c: authentication, but not authorization (w/o user intervention for login, etc.)
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * searching? PH not sure.
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * not embargoed content? Niz: CJ hasn't assigned JR the project yet.&nbsp; Snapshot content?
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 95% of /content URL in mapping for preview.
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * performance? (Niz: MySQL probably will be bottleneck. Splitting reads from writes is non trivial. )
    <br />
    <br />
    no alerting; no embargo; no authenticqtion; citation manager; no e-letters;
    <br />

  CD:
  <br />
  In terms of what's doable for June, I think we'll
  <font>
   need to go back to the priorities
   <font>
    set out in the original plan and work out which of the new items added since then have to be done by June. Anyway can we discuss this in more detail on tomorrow's call.

       CD: Our new Drupal person started today, Xabier Maeztu, and he'll be joining us on Monday's call. This should speed things up our end.
       <font>
        Roger and Daniel are actually quite confident that we can have a pretty complete site by the end of June
        <font>
         ,
         <font>

          Why the disconnect w/reality?
          <br />
          *Onus on RB/DB to explain the disconnect. Either upcoming work is easier; or we'll get it done fast; or our velocity is already increased.
          <br />
          <br />
          RG: Need a better definition of &quot;done&quot;,
          <br />
          code complete; developer has said it's complete; it's been tested; automated tests run; business owner has signed off (and changed task status).

            <br />
            <br />
            2. Defer things, and launch site without some services. Most added things are BMJ burden. TO help HW, we'd have to drop a/c,
            <br />
            * atom db service is slow
            <br />

    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    PH: New releast branch. We will start stable brange. And tag what we have now as alpha1.
    <br />
    Destined for 1.1 goes into dev.
    <br />
    DB: We're still committing. Ex., nodequeue patch.
    <br />
    <br />

    DB: before RB left, there were changes in taxonomy?
    <br />
    <br />
    ===
    <br />

    <br />
    =====
    <br />
    <br />
    TM: HK asked a question re: Google indexing policy, re: the 403 handling.
    <b>
     <font>
      <br />
      HK: Isn't right on live site, and can be left for post-launch.
     </font>
    </b>
    <font>
     <br />
     TM: Let's triage it before, to make sure it's doing what the live site is doing now.
     <br />
     <br />
     <br />
     ============
     <br />
     TM: We will want to review plan for what happens between now and launch with infrastructure and QA team.&nbsp; Some folks here have draconian orientation.
     <br />

  <br />
  =================================================
  <br />
  <br />
  NIZ debrief
  <br />
  * we need a CDN, integrated caching
  <br />
  * proxying is bad
  <br />
  * Our syncing stuff...
  <br />
  &quot;We like the interface, but the implementation has grown in weird ways&quot;
  <br />
  Use somehitng like MongoDB.&nbsp; rebuild w/Java application (or Tomcat, if needed - rather not). OK to have a rDBMS, maybe hooked through the java applet.
  <br />
  <br />
  6 month project, not a two year project.
  <br />
  <br />
  Vertex would become row in table...
  <br />
  <br />
  Woudl liek to be able to partition, so tha I can take bmj or sci branch of the tree down without affecting the others
  <br />
  <br />
  Binary storage is also a problem.
  <br />
  <br />
  SASS is a GLobal single point of failure. It's already failing.
  <br />
  Kenny is putting incredible hardware resources to keep the N pieces
  <br />
  <br />
  Current store is hard to get things into, easy enough to get stuff out
  <br />
  Make it so you can make a mini store on your desktop for regression testing, etc.
  <br />
  <br />
  I want trigger, so I know whenever anything happens. &quot;Unless triggers have run, don't display&quot;.
  <br />
  <br />
  Need to understand how Babel uses this.
  <br />
  MarkLogic could be downstream of store. To allow the Nick's to have some analysis tools etc. Decision support.
  <br />
  <br />
  ==
  <br />
  W/r/t our SDLC can't ever get a clean Rrequirements handoff
  <br />
  <br />
  Niz: We should develop our drupal journal site template, and then go sell that.
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: our model is: We build systems, that otheres (in india) use to build sites.
  <br />
  TM: It's hard to build web sites is a different model than doing other code development. This isn't like building corporate code (w/top-down decision making)
  <br />
  I have to do
  <b>
   <font>
    templated; highly custom; and all stated commitments

       <font>
        - PH did some thinking yesterday. Within content store, the print issues...POP articles come issue-less.&nbsp; Issues are skeletal represented (&quot;virtual issues&quot;).&nbsp; Print issues were not showing date, b/c it's wrapped up in the virtual issue. Nick is going to make a fix in content handling for new print issues, and then we'll apply a one-time fix for the back content. Then we'll need to refresh into A4D to drupal
        <br />
        <br />
        * blue strip/etc.
        <br />
        <br />
        XM: ... node ID... print issues not appearing... empty sections...&nbsp; [BH didn't understand this]
        <br />
        TM: doesn't surprise me.&nbsp; I'll need to as PH to take a look.
        <br />
        Virtual issues have sections, and references to articles previously published, but the v-issues do not have articles in them.
        <br />
        <br />
        ==
        <br />
        <br />
        TM: WHen the site goes live, the site presentes RSS we're creating.&nbsp; When site goes up, we understand YOU'LL be creating those feeds.
        <br />
        DB: Yup
        <br />
        TM: My concern is we put values in the RSS feeds, and Sean is reliant on those values. Please be sure to provide that data, and Sean certifies them.&nbsp; He's pulling&nbsp; article batch values out, and populating your CMS.

  &quot;We believe that even if short term velocity increases, HW will still have some irreducible tasks, with some [] dependencies that will prevent our final code complete deliverables from accerlating beyond the estimates provided.&quot;

  ===========================
  <br />
  LP: What's custom and not custom, and what we'll not be reusing.
  <br />
  4 months dedicated one person
  <br />
  We called it &quot;custom&quot; in 2010, maybe things have changed. Things that we thought were custom are now not custom.
  <br />
  We've done a lot less front end work.
  <br />
  - required a lot of consulting, debugging, etc. from PH. Consulting/tech support about a month
  <br />
  - PH will make separate list of custom development
  <br />
  - Things we did generalize I don't....
  <br />
  <br />
  * custom meta fields (nlm xml) 4 days
  <br />
  * node, user, term object catching 10 days [Drupal 6, on lin 7]
  <br />
  * subj coll - need..
  <br />
  * cTools - 2 days

    URL MAPPING / REDIRECTS
    <font>
     <br />
     TM:&nbsp; PH and I talked about this, ... URLs in Drupal are arbitrary.
     <br />
     For articles (figures, data supplements), and TOC, we
     <font>
      recommend, that we use the URL patterns in current in use on H2O
      <font>
       .&nbsp; This removes redirection issues. But also, for OpenURL providers, it keeps you in a good place.
       <br />
       <font>
        Jon: Sounds reasonable
        <font>
         <br />
         TM:&nbsp; what are your other concerns?
         <br />
         DB: Will PDFs keep same URLs?
         <br />
         PH: I'd like to fix that. Same for images, and whatnot.
         <br />
         TM: We'll map abstract requests to accessible long.
         <br />
         TM: We can redirect all variants to accessible long, and that will get us to the proper variant for that user.
         <br />
         PH: Those will be &quot;permanently used&quot; redirects.
         <br />
         <br />
         TM: Subject collections pages, archive pages, etc. Less of a concern.&nbsp; We can always redirect for those.&nbsp; SO survey the current dev site, and see if there
         <br />
         <br />
         XM/DB: Archive Page? Rapid responses?
         <br />
         <br />
         Jon: Do all existing URLs need to redirect? Edge cases, where we reimplement or remove.
         <br />
         XX: Yes.
         <br />
         DB: for &quot;Resources&quot; site, that has to happen on bmjgroup side.
         <br />
         <br />
         Jon: Search results page??
         <br />
         PH: for dynamic pages, we shouldn't worry so&nbsp; much. We should capture the search page, and move them to the new page.&nbsp; But not try to reprocess search results.
         <br />
         <br />
         TM: We'll write up what we're going to do for articles (and pieces) and TOC URLs. That'll layout patterns.&nbsp; And we'll describe linking to explicit variants. Then we need to look to you for requirements.
         <br />

                                   re alerting service, it would be good to get an idea of how much work has been done on this, whether it's just analysis and a bit of development or whether it's more less than this as I don't think we can really defer it for very long after the main launch

  1. abstract/extract on challenge page. e-mailed yesterday
  <br />
  <br />
  <font>
   According to our design we are supposed to have two different messages from marketing depending on what kind of variable we're seeing, abstract or extract. My first idea was to put two visibility rules, one for not passing the ac with the full variant, and other one, passing the ac with the abstract or extract variant . But I'm not sure if this is going to work. Is there any way of knowing programmatically if an article has an abstract?

    PH: there is a function in the code &quot;determine accessible long&quot;, which will tell you what they have access to. You might be able to pivot on that.

  <br />
  CD: Search?
  <br />

  <br />
  PH: Large cover images. HWX does not keep the original large cover iamges. WOrking with HWX to make sure they are retained. A backlog is possible. If you have all of the previous cover and expansion images, and we can import all of those.

   login page logic going in Drupal locally. That's great, but you don't need support in realtime request.

   <br />
   But we;re investing in the drupal front end, and we're going to have to duplicate this page if we move to another Platform (ex, Wordpress)
   <br />
   <br />
   Jes: we can provide a spec how you rformat shib url, or ppv, url, or if it's a registrant.
   <br />
   We already have error conditions documented.

        ON bmj login page, there is an option to log in as Athens or your Institution,

        From the login page, there is an &quot;Athens / Shib&quot; link, which goes to an intermediate page, where you can pick your federation.&nbsp; Will treat this as outside our scope, Not clear how to handle this at the moment.
        <br />
        <br />

        Make sure that HTTP-based SSO works, through the Drupal site. We'll want to test it with the BMJ at some point.

  <br />
  not desirable to hold alert info on drupal site - last ditch backup plan
  <br />
  <br />
  rather, when a user asks for an e-letters alert, that should be recorded in H20.
  <br />
  Then when a Drupal e-letter is published, Drupal should tell the H2O alerting system that this event has occurred.
  <br />
  <br />
  It may be the first of a new category of alerts that are triggered on &quot;external&quot; events.
  <br />
  At all times, the H2O alerts system should have the complete and canonical signup info.

  As CJ said, &quot;We're using a single data access protocol (APP), which access a variety of services: a/c, alerts, content, ... &quot;
  <br />
  <br />
  users db on Drupal will be like content model. Enough &quot;metainfo&quot; held locally to be useful, but not everything.

   Team,
   <br />
   I'm attaching my notes from the Drupal AC meeting this afternoon. �Please expand or correct as appropriate. �Thanks, Rich.

     <br />
     4-11-2011 � AC Meeting
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    <br />
    Attendees: Jes, Patrick, Anupam, Todd, Craig, Ryan, Rich
    <br />
    Today we�re discussing only AC for Content, AC for Services will be another conversation.

      AuthZ: I'm
      <font>

     <br />
     Gathering info in Drupal layer and passing to AuthZ � IP Address and all cookies. Are there other pieces, referring URL or (better)
     <font>
      <br />
      All Headers including x-type headers, query string params. Follow-up with Ryan for further details.

       </font>
      </b>
      <font>
       <br />
       Opportunities page � user may not have authority to access desired page, the opportunities page is where the user can explore available avenues for getting to the desired page. Craig has created
       <font>
        prototype
        <font>
         . Ideally, service will return both default markup and data as fields which allows client app to dictate display. Shared AC webapp available to the publisher is goal. Needs to be
         <font>
          single component, moving in direction
          <font>
           of shared service that is commonly used by all apps.
           <br />
           Greg, John and Jes should participate in conversation with Craig for next steps. Craig will get AC team looking at his mockup.

   CJ: there is an APP alerts API
   <br />
   You POST&nbsp; a new alert atom..
   <br />
   and you can GET the list of what the user had signed up for.
   <br />
   No direct db, no
   <br />
   part of this exists now. Did a lot of work with BMJ. They feed us alert sign ups. (Etoc)
   <br />
   CiteTrack alerts could be done.
   <br />
   There's a schema for feeding as a batch. (Every wednesday they send us 1,000,000 alerts (full replace)).&nbsp; We do a big diff and load the changes. JWatch does that as well.
   <br />
   Documented.. google site/ system development /alert sync /....
   <br />
   Interactive (real time) is not there.
   <br />
   etoc, editors choice, subject collection, press release...
   <br />
   bmjj's are included, but they're only sending
   <br />
   CJ: &quot;It's not a significant developer effort... If I had any developers. It's a medium development.&quot;
   <font>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    CJ: Big biz priority for 2011: Get rid of as many proxies of H10 as possible, so we can reduce % of sites we host.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alerts is a biggie. The system work is medium big, the app's got a lot of templates to work out, including overrides for special sites.
    <br />
    Native needed:
    <br />
    - archive page building
    <br />
    - alerts
    <br />
    - file manager&nbsp; (could go under a unified master FM server)
    <br />
    - the olittle stuff like feedback page, etc, which we coudl &quot;knock out a week per&quot;
    <br />
    + still need to provide a solution for /maint. Could maybe do as a shared site.
    <br />
    <br />
    aspect 1: no reliance on h10 runtime (the web site)
    <br />
    aspect 2: othe rstuff that needs maint (File manager, maint), how do we put under Pisa multisite (etc) architecture
    <br />
    aspectr 3: remove dependencies on content db. I've triaged that (ex., dispaly collections, subject collectiosn, flags, ), APP service that lets you collect entries for what used to be in content db.
    <br />
    <br />
    lightweight, cache-friendly, &quot;acontent collections&quot;, app-compliant atom store.&nbsp; Ancillary to atom store. Same technology and collect users, or subs, or whatever.

Now, you have to register at HW with UN/PWD.&nbsp; If that's to remain at HW, we'd want the front end to be on Drupal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Form in Drupal, api to HW back end.&nbsp;&nbsp; Handle username already exists, field is blank, etc etc. We need to a way to push the alert requeset to HW end.

  PH:&nbsp; RSS, or HW module lite (from atom store), or full load of the other SJ content
  <br />
  HK: It would be nice to not have to build RSS feeds each time. But no need for full SJ articles. Still have to be able to use taxonomy.
  <br />
  PH: we need more in depth spec of what is needed... maybe it's in PivotalTracker?
  <br />
  <br />
  HK: It's going to be *exactly* the same for the SJs as it is for the BMJ. So let us build the BMJ first.

  email matrix signup / hw deliver

  drupal/ bmjg delivers

  hk: long term, not sure. B/c HW will fulfill eTOCs, and want bmj to deliver all the rest.
  <br />
  Abandoned plan to have everything in one place.
  <br />
  hk: email matrix isn't working well. It's very very complicated at our end, not simple for users. It's a marketing project.&nbsp; Requires separate registration, with lots of personal info, even if all you want is a correction alert
  <br />
  <br />
  Niz: export to ..
  <br />
  HK: Yeah, you export to us for eTOCs.
  <br />
  HK: Let's have a generic &quot;icon&quot; tag
