     I know I've brought this up before, but I don't think we followed through...maybe you did when I wasn't in the room. Is it time to get some air time at the PbM meeting, and explain that the PMO is on a cost recovery basis, so if you want PjM help, you gotta write it into the budget?� It might head off some unrealistic expectations.

  Reminders regarding getting onto the queue for XSL work - the queue that we've been calling &quot;Rachel's queue&quot;:
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all tasks must go into QuickBase to get any work attention on them
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; viewing the current queues for Rachel and her XSL team is simple:
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; www.quickbase.com / HW Project Tracker / Task Details /&nbsp; &quot;Rachel's Task List, by Priority&quot;
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notes:
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the legend at the top of that page explain the various priority codes
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; priorities from 99 -&gt; 0 (as well as those with no assigned priority) all have meaning
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a priority of &quot;99&quot; is the highest priority (stated because its counterintuitive to some)
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there are actually two queues on one page
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one for Rachel's team
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one for Rachel to respond to personally
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rachel invites questions and dialog, in person or via phone, during her daily &quot;office hours&quot; that are so marked on her Google calendar
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; escalation - if you are shepherding a task you believe needs higher priority than you see on the queue
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; escalation is to Margo and Ron

   HW Priority - algorithm created by Mark J. Based on business rules. Between 1 and about 15.&nbsp; (15 is highest) 20=urgent bug fix.
   <br />
   <br />
   Five star rating system. &quot;Customer Priority&quot;. Only 1 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for each publisher.
   <br />
   <br />
   PjM can set the &quot;Task Priority&quot;.
   <br />
   <br />
   MK: I think the five star/one of each system breaks down for Projects
   <br />
   MK: Projects often have somewhat dedicated staff.
   <br />
   MK: Big problem is for XSL or designer providing access across teams. They need some indicator.
   <br />
   <br />
   Escalation:
   <br />
   MK: Mark J is arbiter to adjust the HW priority. #2 is Louise Page. #3 Margo.....
   <br />
   <br />
   MK: At start of year, we have to make date commitments for our work. That means we'll be

     MK/PLT:&nbsp; PjM needs input into when a task needs to be delivered.
     <br />
     Need to keep in touch with Functional managers who own the resources, to make sure they know our needs.
     <br />
     MK: Separate team coming up for Major Projects, Migrations and Launches. Will have a manager - Paul B- who has enough time to track resource commitments, etc. He will work with us.

                            First, no hours you have already accrued are lost. You retain them forever.

                            It's what happens when the system attempts to accrue more hours that is affected.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Catalina told us last month that Jan. 31 is when the system first bounds new attempts to accrue hours to the 240-hour limit - when it attempts to accrue January's vacation hours. If you're above 240, you get no accrual (but you keep what you have). If you're below, you get accrual, but only up to 240 hours.

  Tom,

  <br />
  The conversation Monday in Directors spun up a number of threads - both short-term and long-term - as well as both management and development teams. We've resolved much of the immediate. We've identified issues and laid groundwork for the mid- and long-term. Here's the summary:
  <br />
  <b>
   <u>
    <font>
     <br />
     Project Management
    </font>
   </u>
  </b>
  <font>
   :
   <br />
   <br />
   The immediate gap - the cry for help Anh raised with Ed - was for project management for mSites. No other�Q4 and Q1 Roadmap�roll-outs have the size, scope or complexity of m-Sites and most if not all were already covered: except for mSites, we had previously identified / diverted resources�from other work�to manage and do Roadmap roll-outs.
   <br />
   <br />
   The need closely resembles the project management role we brought Dharm Singh in to perform for mobile sites and mobile apps.?
   <br />
   <br />
   I should probably put &quot;project management&quot; in quotes. This is an odd project management role. Typical project management encompasses taking a long project, breaking it down into parts, estimating, scheduling, and managing. This role (whether for mobile or mSites), on the other hand, is much more sales-side,�encompassing�setting up process to rapidly execute�flurries of�roll-outs, from order-checking (&quot;is it standard? customization required?&quot;) to configuring to, if outside standard boundaries, a fair amount of customer interaction. Where Matt has envisioned the product and ensured pilots embody the vision, Dharm's role is to optimize starting from that point to make products emerge from the &quot;factory&quot; with precision and predictability.
   <br />
   <br />
   We variously found ourselves calling the role: Implementation Manager, Product Owner, Construction Manager, and�Rollout Manager.?
   <br />
   <br />
   Dharm has proven highly capable of so executing�and has reduced the load that rolling out mobile products�require such that he can and will take on mSites as well, with support from Mahesh Bhavan.
   <br />
   <br />
   As is also different from classic project management, the role deserves cross-training and backup for Dharm. Mahesh can provide in the short term.?
   <br />
   <br />
   If we were in a for-profit company, we would have salespeople who own not just customers but who own particular products - and we would also have TAMs or SEs - Technical Account Managers or Sales Engineers. It's the TAM/SE role that we all think is the role we're quasi putting Dharm into. We do spread ownership of knowledge of products from product managers to the dozen publication managers - but most of them really don't do selling (they all take orders, but not many sell) - and all are swimming in a sea of product features about which few have much depth. We simply don't have sales people who specialize in products.?
   <br />
   <br />
   Salespeople who specialize in particularly products - as well as the TAM / SE role - are to provide�depth about the product�in customer conversations. They are staff who have both both customer and product skills. With their product skills and technical backgrounds, they are able to vet customer requests to determine whether customers are truly ordering our standard product or a configured version of our standard product - or they're actually asking for a custom version that is outside the scope of the standard product short of a development effort. With their customer relationship skills, they can communicate that effectively. Lacking anyone in those roles, we believe that Matt and Dharm can identify the correct responses, which then need to be delivered by publication managers - and that rest of the TAM/SE role is Dharm's. As I said, it's not traditional project management, so we're lucky to have found a project manager with the skills to slip into this role. His former life as a programmer provides him the technical background the role demands, in fact.
   <br />
   <br />
   To note one other issue caused by our lack of product sales and TAM/SE roles: we have instead given PbMs responsibility both to maintain�customer�relationships and to sell things. But giving PbMs both responsibilities is rife with conflicts. The frequent result is, of course, that PbMs offer stuff free.
   <br />
   <br />
   Risk: Dharm is a single resource; mid-term, we need to pair him with another and cross-train.
   <br />
   <br />
   Risk: Dharm is currently contracted only through March. As a result, Dharm is beginning to look for a full-time employment position with Stanford. His skills are critical to these Roadmap rollouts and unusual among project managers and while it took him (and takes everyone we hire to manage projects and now rollouts) time to come up to speed - to have the experience with our systems to be able to do the business analysis piece of the role - he is now experienced and has acquired knowledge ownership.?
   <br />
   <br />
   Anh and Matt believe that the role is a continuing one, not short-term. I concur.
   <br />
   <br />
   I strongly recommend that we hire Dharm into an FTE role / make him an employee.

    :
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    There's another issue in the Roadmap not immediately obvious before getting to this point, and that's the date at which products are available.?
    <br />
    <br />
    Product developers, whether in my organization or Mark's or Bill's, tend to equate completing the product with availability. Too frequently missing are plans for who will deploy�and how:�the time and timing that deployment requires, the resourcing that deployment requires both in development and in management resources, and the documentation that the deployment team needs from the product team.

     All of that led Margo to recommend to Anh that she add a handshake for rollouts - that we all explicitly identify rollout responsibility and approach, and that Anh add a column to the roadmap spreadsheet to so specify. (Examples: for MathJAX, &quot;opt-in, Xenia&quot; �or &quot;opt-in, Bill&quot; would be the entry; �recommendation services, &quot;opt-in, Margo&quot;; �WYSIWYG, &quot;opt-out, Margo&quot;; mSites, &quot;opt-in, Todd/Dharm&quot;. Note with the last, that the manager of resources and manager of rollout particulars are not the same.)
     <br />
     <br />
     Rollout requirements vary substantially based on whether the feature is being rolled out globally, or is intended to be made available via opt-in, or via opt-out.
     <br />
     <br />
     The new roadmap column, which Anh has added, identifies where we have gaps at the highest level that need to be filled in - both in understanding the implications of the approach and in ownership (and, when the rollout is as substantial as mSites, the project management ownership required).
     <br />
     <br />
     <br />
     Below the level of approach, though, there are substantial questions that need to be asked and in some cases answered that our discussions revealed. They include:
     <br />
     - is this rollout applicable to any remaining H1O sites (this is a question we have grown used to asking, for the most part)
     <br />
     - are there rollout considerations for sites that are not standard, e.g., the�20 initial H2O sites not yet converted to the current generated architecture
     <br />
     - are there issues wrt sites already deployed in the multi-site architecture vs those that are not yet -�H2O sites with umbrellas that were created prior to 2010
     <br />
     - do rollouts differ if sites are in Drupal, not Classic

      Anh had started developing a�Product Release�Checklist in collaboration with various of us.
      <br />
      <br />
      Having drilled down another level, and seen the complexity more involved than once envisioned, it's clear that that level requires more planning and earlier involvement.?
      <br />

      Margo picked up the�Product Release�Checklist end of last week and is fleshing it out to another layer of detail needed.

       For reasons having to do with both the JD group's focus on H2O migrations as well as the need, during the R&amp;D phase of Drupal development, for tight collaboration between Drupal platform developers and Drupal JDs, Todd took on both platform development and journal development. Thus far, the platform team has built core services and portals but not yet a journal. With migrations coming to an end, combined with the benefits of again co-mingling journal developers of all kinds, and the platform team more and more taxed in multiple directions, we're planning together, if nascently so, the transition of on- and off-shore Drupal JDs to Margo, Greg and Paul, with the support of Shanti. Onshore, Todd has prompted Chapter 3 to prepare training for onshore JDs in Drupal that, unlike the very non-specific Stanford Drupal trainings we've seen to date, will be specific to journal development with Drupal. Offshore, Shanti will be in Pune supporting the offshore Classic JDs late January / early February and can begin to connect the Drupal and Classic JD teams both there and here.�It will take considerable planning, but this transition should be able to be made seamless.

         The drill-down revealed additional insights into project management:
         <br />
         - the ones above - that rollout is a unique set of project management skills quite different from the traditional ones
         <br />
         - the value in project managing at HighWire of a technical background: our successful project managers either have a lot of HighWire experience or they leverage highly technical backgrounds (typically for having been programmers)
         <br />
         - the ramp-up time for project managers to become successful at leveraging resources across the company - and even knowing which resources to leverage - is months-long; we can't just bring in a project manager and have them be useful; we either need considerable lead time to plan for project management needs - or we need to keep what is variously called &quot;spinning reserve&quot; or &quot;bench&quot;

         What's on Dharm's plate, with taking on mSites:
         <font>
          <br />
          - OUP &amp; SAGE full-text apps
          <br />
          - continued mobile web, with focus on the big three: Duke, BMJ &amp; GSW
          <br />
          - initial mSite rollout
          <font>
           <br />
           What makes it viable for Dharm to take on all three areas:
           <br />
           - Anh's estimate that uptake will be in the 6-8 publishers EoQ4 and beginning of Q1, that is, that we can do first a controlled rollout that we can turn into a full-on rollout
           <br />
           - Dharm's and Matt's assessments that mSites will follow the pattern of mobile web
           <br />
           - Mahesh can back up Dharm, though his contract is scheduled to end mid-January
           <br />
           - Matt�can bridge the gap if demand truly spikes, while raising a cry for help as early as possible
           <br />
           - Matt can get some of the order-form process ironed out yet this month, with Mahesh and perhaps Ellen's help
           <br />
           -
           <font>
            <br />
            WiCK can be easily transferred from Dharm, if necessary (it's unusual to have a feature with as low a learning curve as WiCK)

  MR - we did 1000 mobile sites in a year. But M-sites have more variability
  <br />
  Initial implementations would be Pilots
  <br />
  half a day for first site out of each set. 2 hours for subsequent on followons.
  <br />
  <br />
  2 full months to roll out top 30 ... [ (two full-time months ]
  <br />
  Anh's estimates were more like 6-8.&nbsp; (12 days, 3 work weeks)
  <br />
  MR: They'll fit in Q1.
  <br />
  Sage, OUP full app are also going on Q1
  <br />
  DS: some of his load is going to be lightened on mobile app.
  <br />
  Mobile web is in control.&nbsp; GSW, BMJ, Duke (40 sites for each).&nbsp; I've told the PbMs we're going to launch 3-4 sites pilots, and then a couple of flights after that.&nbsp; Complete in Q2.
  <br />
  <br />
  Top Priority for DS :
  <br />
  1 m site launches;
  <br />
  2 handful modbile web;
  <br />
  3 Sage/OUP full text app
  <br />
  <br />
  MR can help double up - should have cycles in Q1

   DS:&nbsp; WiCK is admin work, wihtout much knowledge transfer.
   <br />
   <br />
   MR: Less technical person could keep work around the order forms under control.
   <br />
   Post demo's in January, business could ramp up.
   <br />
   <br />
   [ET: for mobile WiCK work. ]
   <br />
   DS: making some Drupal config (ex., creating logins, ads, etc) could be used.

        <br />
        <br />
        can he handle it
        <br />
        mobile app and WiCK do not use Drupal
        <br />
        (nor analytics, shopping cart, etc)
        <br />

        ===
        <br />
        <br />
        RL: M-sites - like CME&lt; needs a real SALES person who is familiar with the product. A product salesperson, not a PjM.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The processing of those order forms that Matt was telling us about, that's a

         , not a PjM.&nbsp;&nbsp; PbMs can't be expert in all our features.

         RL: We don't know anything about selling here!
         <br />
         <br />
         AB: It's critical the PbMs take on this role.
         <br />
         <br />
         RL: Who is the expert on these products? Not PjMs - it can't be.

         AB: It can't be the PdM.
         <br />
         <br />
         RL: PbMs should sell, and take orders, but they should have specialist sales product owner.

          <br />
          <br />
          AB: M-sites is #1 agenda item for Q4.
          <br />
          RL: DS said eh could handle. What's the volume. In Q4/Q1 - 6 or so publishers will want to start by mid-January.&nbsp; General queries (via PbMs) who will demo, do videos, etc. And expose them to order for process. How quickly&nbsp; they move is question. in Q1. MR still forecasting. Plus RFP demos, where we create the orders ourselves.
          <br />
          RL: OK, that volume is doable w/Dharm.

  Using Mahesh's recent experience as an example, it would be a good idea to make &quot;stakeholder identification&quot; a formal part of the PMO process, for every project, large or small.
  <br />
  <br />
  This would include internal and external stakeholders, and the template should definitely include webmasters.
  <br />
  <br />
  Note that this is one of the items in the Concept/Charter document.
  <br />
  <br />
  Please throw this one on the pile for items which we might formally adopt as part of our PMO processes.

  <br />
  <br />
  In general, there are three categories of things: bug, change request, (everything else, = PRD)
  <br />
  <br />
  PRD is a business case/sort of functional spec. Not a tech spec.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Functional spec might have things like use cases, screen shots, etc etc.
  <br />
  <br />
  - release schedule

  <br />
  NLM Medline Indexing Requirement for electronic journals (found by surfing)
  <br />
  http://www.pdfa.org/news/us-national-institutes-of-health-offers-pdfa-option-for-medline-indexing/
  <br />
  http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/ma11/ma11_ejournal.html
  <br />
  New policy:...
  <br />
  1. Provide NLM with XML-tagged data of its bibliographic citations.
  <br />
  2. Provide robust current access to all its content under a license allowing efficient support of NLM operations, onsite services, and interlibrary loan.
  <br />
  3. Have an acceptable arrangement for permanent preservation of, and access to, the published content.
  <br />
  2+3 can be met by membership in PMC, or in external archive plus deposit of PDF/A (for internal NLM operations) {David G authored}
  <br />
  <br />
  ======================================
  <br />
  <br />
  QUESTIONS
  <br />
  1. Are we going to be expected to keep these (larger) PDFs forever -- archiving them as we do the current ones?
  <br />
  (BW: guess is &quot;yes&quot;.)[PW: &quot;yes&quot;, ex for resupplies]
  <br />
  <br />
  2. Are we going to need to be able to make them available in any other way than the PubMed deposit? If yes, then what might you speculate?
  <br />
  (BW gut is &quot;yes&quot;. ) [PW: don't know of any others]
  <br />
  Big problem if we guess &quot;no&quot;, and it's wrong later on
  <br />
  <br />
  3. Will this be for content going forward only, or are we going to need to load back content with these additional PDFs?
  <br />
  (BW: guess &quot;yes&quot;.)[PW: make it separate project]
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Who:
  <br />
  0)&nbsp; typesetter should generate the pdfs.&nbsp; HW may not have the font library to embed, and there are other characteristics of archival pdf
  <br />
  <br />
  1) HWX team will need to develop a workflow to accept and process the second PDF variant.
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bw: we do need to change a workflow, we already have extra PDFs. Need to define naming convention, location in fiilesystem, that plus workflow,
  <br />
  <br />
  2) Deliveries to PubMed -- downstream deliveries to PubMed may also need to change
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bw: script that&nbsp; dominoes runs,&nbsp; makepubmedmatches.
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two places that we generate medlars format. Earlier, it was done in the parser (h1O still does this in places). 7 years ago, we said let's do this out of the db...&nbsp; The medlars generated by those two are slightly different. Script (evan?) needs to pick up the archival PDF, and then insert into the XML for this medlars the line that says &quot;and here's this PDF/A&quot;. So need a file configuration at the journal level, etc., that says if this is type A or B. Not sure if Paul S.
  <br />
  <br />
  3) Atom team for new variant
  <br />
  <br />
  4) JDs probably have to load new variant in h1o as well,�
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ? dominoes
  <br />
  <br />
  5) back data delivery would be separate
  <br />
  <br />
  6)&nbsp;&nbsp; We�ll need to price this service (including storage) as well.
  <br />
  <br />
  7) Access control as well if we ever want to serve it to users.
  <br />
  <br />
  Q4:
  <br />
  <br />
  Stakeholders:
  <br />
  Dom - PbM
  <br />
  <br />
  HWX: KH, NN, BW
  <br />
  PubMed team: Evan
  <br />
  Atom: Nick
  <br />
  JD:&nbsp; MK/PB/ =&gt; GS
  <br />
  cc:TM as option
  <br />
  <br />
  - How much work
  <br />
  - dependencies
  <br />
  -
  <br />
  Schedule committments!
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Notes:
  <br />
  * Qx: is this publication not being indexed at all now?
  <br />
  * schedule, to set the expectations for OUP/CTSNet.; �

  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Archival PDFs for online only journals to pubmed&quot;. We've been just sending abstracts, they want non-normal PDFs.
  <br />
  Louise opened QB record. OUP may have surfaced??

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; 16 Jan target in jeopardy
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
   Paul B: SMPTE: CJ a/c this week; search might actually make it; Might use CHOICE search;
   <br />
   MK: might move launch to 23rd.
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 1b. Gump launch
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; &quot;in progress&quot; since 2009?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; PbM not motivated to keep working on it due to
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lack of customer involvement
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; this project appears to need executive support
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 1c. BESBJS migration and launch
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; sense that project scope is still evolving, yet
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; due date is ~1 month away
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; Angie and Bernard need to meet with Phac to
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; figure out what's happening with this one
   <br />
   <br />
   MK: A red flag - Xia is concerned she can't do all of the tiny pixel moving they're asking for.
   <br />
   JP back Thursday.
   <br />
   Need a meeting of the right people, maybe Greg S, to review what is left, who is doing them when are they getting them doine, and so forth.
   <br />
   <br />
   RL: is all of this in scope?
   <br />
   MK: huge document, was signed, still fuzziness, I expect
   <br />
   JP: I'd be shocked if we launched on 25th....
   <br />
   BW: if there is any culpability on our part w/r/t the 25th, that's our problme, not customer's.
   <br />
   <br />
   XPS: We have a adequate content in dev. TM knows.
   <br />
   TM: should be there as well.
   <br />
   MK: Xia's Concern was about functionality. She needs help in knowing what she can and can't do.

   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 2a. SAGEKE
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; what prerequisites does this project have?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; can we shift target from 1/01/2012 to something
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more realistic?
   <br />
   <br />
   BW: Will follow STKE. No longer gets new content. A simplified STKE. IF we schedule Mid-July for STKE, we'll be working on Sage for May. SO maybe a september date...
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 2b. Journal Watch
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; any news on this front?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; can we shift target from 1/01/2012 to something
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more realistic?

   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 2c. Meeting Sites

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; draft strategy document for the roadmap?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; can we shift target from 1/01/2012 to something
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more realistic?
   <br />
   <br />
   BW: drawing a blank... Lots of discussions... will check...
   <br />
   MK: Yeah, was a Roadmap item.
   <br />
   MK: should external meeting abds sites be integrated intot he mother site.
   <br />
   BW: contente isn't driver. Will need to talk to ABui.

     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; something more realistic at that point
     <br />
     <br />
     PB: Duke, two other small ones. Duke design will have to wait when I come back from vacation to plan.
     <br />
     <font>
      [from 10/26 meeting:
      <br />
      MK: Duke portal will be easier. Anh says Duke is eager to get it up.

       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; any benefit in starting to think about journal
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; migrations now? remember: custom transform will
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be required, we might want a full resupply of
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elsevier archives, one of the sites is a book
       <br />

       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; do we want to push ahead without waiting for a
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decision? if so, should we do this without their
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; involvement?
       <br />
       <br />

       BW: Still have several volumes of letters to ....
       <br />
       <br />

  &gt;&gt; Hi, Ron.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; Had my meeting with Mahesh.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; Mahesh has some important personal business he needs to take care of.&nbsp; His father and mother live with him, and his father has dementia, which is worsening. His parents have asked him to take them back to India, so his father can settle retirement financial business.
  <br />
  &gt;&gt;
  <br />
  &gt;&gt; Mahesh has asked if it would be possible to take
  <b>

    21 November though 2 December
   </font>
  </b>
  <font>
   off for the trip.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, as of 1 Nov,&nbsp; he has two migrations assigned. One migrates on 2 Nov (ASH Ed Book), and one on 15 November (AJS). We hope the latter will continue to be smoothly sailing.
   <br />
   &gt;&gt;
   <br />
   &gt;&gt; Given these facts alone, this looks fine to me.
   <b>

   <font>
    for those two weeks, handling whatever AJS cleanup there might be.
    <br />
    &gt;&gt;
    <br />
    &gt;&gt; The context confuses me.&nbsp; By 1 Nov, Mahesh is projected to be down to 30% FTE.&nbsp; I would normally be loading his plate back up now.

    <br />
    &gt;&gt; Note that If he's out two weeks, that's two weeks we can spend on him later (i.e., after his return), fwiw.
    <br />
    &gt;&gt;
    <br />
    &gt;&gt; What do you think?

     &nbsp;&nbsp; committed to starting work on it in 2011?

     Deceased editor, but it's continuing
     <br />
     BW: This is a standalone bundle. Same mindset.
     <br />
     XPS: we will tell them we'll migrate you to our new platform.

      MK: GSW portal plan is in place. It's MUCH worse than Duke.&nbsp; March 20th.&nbsp; Planned and staffed. Exec Dir here next week. As little as proxying as we can.&nbsp; Very nice plan. Eileen is JD, Shanti is building the services. Jen will do UI work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Needs lots of MAF time.

       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; Paul is working on this
       <br />
       PB: OUP journals (not as anxious as Duke). OUP team (not mig team) will do that.&nbsp; LW has a project to complete before that can be done (alert signups via JEL codes
       <br />
       <br />
       PB: Minor umbrellas will be done next year, by the JD owner)

       8. books discussed at roadmap

       &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; sense that the H2O platform needs to be &quot;fixed&quot; for
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; books before we migrate anything else
       <br />
       <br />
       MK: Want to talk about
       <br />
       aptaguide, sepm and erm&nbsp; (and new AORN, new SEPM).
       <br />
       Wanted to focus on the platforms for existing publications. Big pushback from team on redbook.
       <br />
       <br />
       BW: OUPhandbooks in H10. We won't even put those on the schedule until we get most or all of the H1O dependencies onto H2O.&nbsp;&nbsp; So 2nd half of 2012.
       <br />
       BW: Redbook is different, b/c old versions are almost never used.
       <br />
       SEPM has over 150 books
       <br />
       ERM 40+
       <br />
       <br />
       PB: Books codebase will be a nightmare to sort.
       <br />
       MK: It may be cheaper to buy a new sofa than to reupholster the existing one.

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; launch process - especially the start - should be better defined

    <br />
    <br />
    =================
    <br />
    Assuming budget $'s work out...
    <br />
    WE NEED TO DECIDE dharm, gregory, mahesh - only 2 to extend to March.
    <br />
    Greg wants insight into that decision by 4th November.
    <br />
    <br />
    Terminate mid-December.
    <br />
    <br />
    RL: Work still keeps coming in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No bench anywhere at HW. JD, Systems, PjM.&nbsp;&nbsp; No budget to do it.
    <br />
    <br />
    =======================================
    <br />
    <br />
    RL: AdV came unglued while you were gone.
    <br />
    She missed first meeting, we did go-'round
    <br />
    Updates. Good meeting.
    <br />
    AdV should've let me know she was supposed to do that.
    <br />
    <br />
    I asked TC to do it, sent out agenda
    <br />
    &quot;Nobody thinks she's important.&quot;
    <br />
    Seems to have emerged less frequently since I've managed her.
    <br />
    Self-esteem issue.
    <br />
    The day I met her, she can to Palo Alto to resign. Spoke to her at lunch over Publisher Meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was my motivator to make community of practice. Give her a base.
    <br />
    <br />
    Making her migration maven was stroke of genius.
    <br />
    But where does she go from there. With end of journal migrations, what does that mean.
    <br />
    BH: Future in books? big enough?
    <br />
    RL: Is it big enough? Will it feed her self-esteem adequately?&nbsp;&nbsp; Books is a huge problem, can she help us with it?
    <br />
    BH: Books team? sense of place? process? etc.
    <br />
    RL: should book role extend into product management.
    <br />
    Traditional product management role is to do product vision and project management.
    <br />
    <br />
    Role relative to PMO is trickier. I had envisioned me running the&nbsp; PMO with TC as &quot;architect&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that doesn't have AdV in a role. She thought she had one.
    <br />
    RL: Migration work was above and beyond her grade level.

               i've discussed this with a few other people, and the consensus is that
               <br />
               since we're 2+ weeks out [beyond] from the migration of jsedres/palaios, it falls to the pbm to track this to completion with site-support. however, whether that's the correct answer in general, whether that answer applies in this case, and how that answer should be communicated to lindat are questions that i would like bernard to comment on.
               <br />
               <br />
               bernard, perhaps we can discuss this question when the pmo meets this afternoon? the question is:
               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp; a bug (hw-wide or project-specfic) has not been resolved at
               <br />
               &nbsp; the 2-week mark that typically ends a pjm's involvement with
               <br />
               &nbsp; a migration. what is the pjm's responsibility as s/he leaves
               <br />
               &nbsp; the project?
               <br />
               <br />
               here are my thoughts:
               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp; - make sure the bug is present in quickbase (or jira, as we
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transition to the new tool)
               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp; - make sure the bug has been brought to the attention of the
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appropriate parties (xenia for content [at her request],
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; site-support for everything else [per paulb and xenia])
               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp; - meet with the pbm to review all outstanding bugs (they
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should all be in either quickbase or jira) and officially
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hand the project over
               <br />

                <br />
                Make sure bug is in QB; make sure assignment is clear;&nbsp; (straight to XPS if content);
                <br />
                - Be sure to have meeting with PbM to close the

                <br />
                - AdV: the platform-wide bugs might be stickier.

  Prelaunch will be primarily morgan (m/w/f) 12/5-12/9 for fixes and cushion).

    <br />
    Ortho: Oct 25. Up against content loading deadline. for signoff on 30th.
    <br />
    <br />
    ===================================================
    <br />
    Next segment involved Phac's long-standing item re: &quot;inter-departmental project structure&quot;, i.e., how does he get what he needs from Engineering. We heard Mark C has hired a &quot;technical program manager&quot;, (&quot;Vishwa&quot;?)� who will help him project-manage his department. How, and what the implications are for the PjMs, has yet to unfold. But it's gotta help!�
    <br />
    <br />
    Ron said &quot;Going forward, ideally we're doing LESS ONE-OFF WORK.&quot;� Which I liked.
    <br />
    ======
    <br />
    Finally, we had a guest star: Rama. He spoke about QA and migrations, which we seem to get wrong regularly.�
    <br />
    <br />
    * Need QA in 6 places
    <br />
    Alpha - [JD or PjM sends mail to QA &quot;Hey, site is ready, sample content there]. WE NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU.. QA then confirms. 2 days-1 wk elapsed FOR ONE JOURNAL
    <br />
    <br />
    Beta - publihser does this testing
    <br />
    <br />
    Content -� Pan era/ previous era. 99% of musikaar + automated. 1 week of elapse for 1 or 2 days of testing.
    <br />
    <br />
    Pre-launch -� 2 week prelaunch for Multijournal migrations.� Has to happen after cut to prod. Site typically has had changes. Also fixed items..� Local team.
    <br />
    <br />
    Launch day - short 1 hr local team. (Jeff or Rama). Acceptance / Sanity test level.
    <br />
    <br />
    post-launch -� Good idea, but we don't have resources to do it.
    <br />
    <br />
    Other comments
    <br />
    + Multijournal migration planning - needs more padding, even when sites are identical, content problems arise.
    <br />
    + leave a cushion!: QA gets &quot;squished&quot;.
    <br />
    + &quot;content load prerequisite&quot; - new column in QA spreadsheet.

             I would like to discuss a new item:
             <br />
             - Inter-department Project structure (wait for Ron)

              PLT: Mark C hired. Vishwa T, Cisco, Technical Program Manager. Organizing still .... Will manage the Drupal side of JBJS-BR
              <br />
              <br />
              RL: VIswa would have taken care of Tien's dropped search requirement.
              <br />
              TC: same suggestion (Vishwa) for STKE.
              <br />
              <br />
              PLT: Will MC hire PJMs as well as PGMs?
              <br />
              Who relates to the portal.
              <br />
              Viswa will answer RFP's in MarkC's world.
              <br />
              <br />
              PLT: I think MarkC might think PgM is in contact with customer.
              <br />
              <br />
              PLT: I think&nbsp; MarkC thinks the Specification of projects&nbsp; Is a tPgM role.
              <br />

              RL: This person will manage the system software development.

  RL: Be SURE to let RL&nbsp; know BEFORE Ian runs out of money. Projection.&nbsp; DON'T LET HIM SLOW DOWN when he gets near.
  <br />
  <br />
  RL: ACTION: reply to your own e-mail ....&nbsp; not all
  <br />
  &nbsp; I can try to open the wider issue of Drupal is not for everything.
  <br />
  Ron won't even let me make my point about Drupal not being supported.
  <br />
  <br />
  ======
  <br />
  <br />
  2 or 3 contractors into March / APril timeframe.
  <br />
  <br />
  Roadmap + professional service paradigm.&nbsp; We've got to nail a whole bunch of revenue, to keep them beyond March/April.
  <br />
  <br />
  We have to be generating revenues before that to provde we cann continue them.

  OUP LP/AB dump on Angie
  <br />
  <br />
  * reassign to LP? or DM?&nbsp; or MJ?
  <br />
  <br />
  Calling angie:
  <br />
  1) RL: please reassign those OUP tasks to Louise.&nbsp; PbM needs to own these maybe take them to Warp.
  <br />
  <br />
  AdV: 2 of these tasks have been around for *years*.&nbsp;&nbsp; LP assigned them to Bill...&nbsp; And AdV is on phone with OUP every week, and they ask her about them.
  <br />
  <br />
  RL: Louise doens't get to do this. &quot;I'm horrified.&quot; Draft your role PjM wise for OUP.
  <br />
  <br />
  2) for AB, request to help move books machinery into h20.
  <br />
  AB sent reuqest for status. I responded &quot;nothing&quot;, no one is updating me.
  <br />
  Todd and CJ downgraded red alert status, AdV not concerned.
  <br />
  <br />
  If I send a QB/Jira update, how long before I escalate.

  Drupal site developers will move into ROn's organization, once the migrations are done.
  <br />
  <br />
  The team in India will do the build
  <br />
  Mark C will get a Technical Project Manager&nbsp; to ride herd on TM, CJ, India
  <br />
  <br />
  The TC will ride herd on JD, Content, a/c, etc will be pjm for the rest
  <br />
  <br />
  * How would TC work with PjM in Engineering
  <br />
  <br />
  TC: I'd like to get a process in place. A one pager for each feature. Time box it. Ex., we'll put 6 weeks in on each feature.
  <br />
  Nancy like structure. Within those 6 weeks, they can change whatever they want, and then if they go over...
  <br />
  TImebox reviews.
  <br />
  Develop, demo, then get feedback.
  <br />
  Generally an agile-ish framework. I.e., useable
  <br />
  <br />
  BH: you'll have to work parallel on UI. Remember, Drupal is all new UI platform.
  <br />
  <br />
  Engineering deliverable date on a per-feature basis.
  <br />
  <br />
  Asked Polly to write the one pagers for the features.
  <br />
  <br />
  Drupal developers are in Indian company &quot;Faichee&quot;, (???)

    <br />

    <font>
     helpful to hear from PjMs on a weekly basis re: migrations:
     <br />
     - which projects they're on
     <br />
     - what milestones are upcoming (e.g. kickoff, alpha,
     <br />
     &nbsp; beta, customer sign-off on beta, content complete,
     <br />
     &nbsp; cutting to prod, final customer approval, launch)
     <br />
     - any problems they've encountered during the week
     <br />
     &nbsp; prior, and whether they have been resolved
     <br />
     - anything they're concerned about for the week ahead
     <font>

  Hi Ron.
  <br />
  <br />
  I have some projections for next year, per your request @ our 11am meeting.&nbsp; There's a lot of creative interpolation in the numbers, as you might imagine.
  <br />
  <br />
  Migrations: 4 FTEs
  <br />
  Between January and end of June, I project 4 FTEs are required.&nbsp; If things go well in Q1 and Q2, this will tail off to about 1 FTE in June (but a lot depends upon when projects actually start)
  <br />
  <br />
  Launches: 20% FTE
  <br />
  If we are&nbsp; carrying the AORN launch,&nbsp;&nbsp; it'll be about 20% for the first two months in 2012
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Special Projects: 3.5 FTE
  <br />
  In this period, we need approximately 3 FTEs to handle the large special projects we know about. This includes
  <br />
  85% mobile etc. product rollouts
  <br />
  60% general books items
  <br />
  <font>
   <br />
   35% JBJS-BR Phase 2
   <font>
    <br />
    <font>
     60% AAP Portal 2015
     <br />
     65% Science mag Drupal reimplementation
     <br />
     50% Paleosource,
     <br />
     [included, not yet funded]
     <font>
      <br />
      <br />
      * This does NOT include miscellaneous smaller projects, which we may expect to receive from the PbMs (like AACR taxonomy, or PNAS/ACS linking).
      <br />
      <br />
      Administrative:&nbsp; .75% FTE
      <br />
      Migration coordination (15%, AdV) and PMO management (60%, BH) are projected to continue at approximately current levels.
      <br />
      <br />
      ====================
      <br />
      <br />
      Notes:
      <br />
      * The OUP books migration to H2O is going to be big and complex.&nbsp; I've currently pegged it at 65%. It may need to be split between an subject matter expert PjM, and another helpful unit
      <br />
      <br />
      * I included AORN largely to call out launches, which are one of the more common emergent projects.
      <br />
      <br />
      * Lydia B, and Linda A, seem to be fully tasked with &quot;permanent projects&quot; concerning&nbsp; Sage, BMJ, and OUP.&nbsp; So while our office permanent FTE count is 5 (BH, AdV, TC, LB, LA) on paper, only three of those FTEs, to my knowledge, are available to address the needs indicated above.
      <br />
      <br />
      * The total FTE request is about 8.5 FTE.&nbsp; We currently have 3 permanent FTE available to apply against this.
      <br />
      * If the contracts are still to be drawn for Portal 2015, Science reimplementation, and Paleosource, you of course could reduce the FTE ask by&nbsp; 1.75 FTE, provided those contracts explicitly included the FTEs here estimated.

          11:46 &lt;bing13&gt; But given what we know, do you think that its something like a 50% FTE effort, for the migration, say Jan-jun 2012?
          <br />
          11:47 &lt;angie&gt; At least.
          <br />
          11:47 &lt;angie&gt; The prospect of actually being done with the books migrations by the middle of next year makes me kind of chuckle.
          <br />
          11:48 &lt;angie&gt; I'm expecting it to take longer than that, and to involve more time than 4 hours per day.
          <br />
          11:48 &lt;angie&gt; The books project by itself is currently at 60% FTE.
          <br />
          11:48 &lt;angie&gt; And I think that the H2O migration is going to be worse.
          <br />
          11:48 &lt;bing13&gt; Right. I stopped at June b/c that was the end of the horizon ron asked for, I didn't meant o imply it would be *done* at that point
          <br />

   <br />
   * reread her note
   <br />
   * would she still be mig resource for PMO team?
   <br />
   * someone else for m/a/x meeting -
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I really fear not having the history, and not tracking that many items.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - leave angie, have another note-taker? even a newbie? +we have some bandwidth+?
   <br />
   <font>
    <br />
    ===========================
    <br />
    <br />
    1a) AdV: I don't feel overburndened. My role at hw is unclear.
    <br />
    People say to me you're critical to XYZ, etc.
    <br />
    I don't know what to do w/migration management. I don't have astaff, I don't have time to build the PMO
    <br />
    I don't understand the &quot;Migration maven&quot; role.&nbsp; &quot;Go to resource&quot; that no body asks me.
    <br />
    Or bill/john/tom go to other people with their questions about migrations.&nbsp; I feel it's a misnomer.
    <br />
    I sit in these meetings, and I take notes, and circulate.&nbsp; I don't want to be a secretary.
    <br />
    <br />
    M/A/X - margo and Xenia have info on migrations, and meet with staff, and do the updates.&nbsp; AdV doesn't know - vacations, updates, anything.&nbsp;&nbsp; I get asked questions, and then I do reserach.
    <br />
    <br />
    <font>
     THIS IS PART OF&nbsp; A BIGGER PROBLEM, AT HW DO i HAVE A CAREER? DO I HAVE A SKILL SET?&nbsp; It's hampered b/c I'm a remote employee. IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT B/C I'M NOT THERE...&nbsp; i don't know if there is an answer.

    Here's a summary of my observations; a more verbose version of this info,
    <br />
    organized by PjM, can be found following my signature.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    1.&nbsp; PMO Problems
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    1a. Target date slippages
    <br />
    1b. Lack of training/oversight
    <br />
    1c. Lack of project ownership?
    <br />
    1d. Insufficient resources to meet demand
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    2.&nbsp; PMO Projects Without Resources
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    2a. CTSNet (4 sites + CME + custom XSLT)
    <br />
    2b. AACC (1 site)
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    3.&nbsp; PMO Projects With Staffing Concerns
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    3a. Ellen:&nbsp; ASHS (3 sites + umbrella)
    <br />
    3b. Mahesh: GSW &quot;mirrors&quot; (4 sites)
    <br />
    3c. Mahesh: ASH bloodbook + umbrella
    <br />
    3d. Ellen:&nbsp; GSW (40 sites)
    <br />
    3e. Mahesh: ATS (3 sites + cme + umbrella)
    <br />
    3f. Mahesh: BIR (3 sites + umbrella)
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    4.&nbsp; PMO Projects Without Schedules
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    4a. Phac: ASHA Newsletters (16 sites + umbrella)
    <br />
    4b. Tien: AAAS (stke/sigtrans)
    <br />

    <br />
    Angie de Villiers
    <br />
    Project Manager
    <br />
    HighWire Press
    <br />
    <br />
    1. Ellen:
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; ASHS is at 20%, and appears to be off-schedule in her
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; absence. Is anybody covering her on either the PbM or
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the PjM side?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; GSW is at 50%, and Margo has concerns about whether
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ellen is the right person for the job. Perhaps we
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should meet up with her to discuss when she's back at
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work next week?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; Can take on one more, perhaps she can pick up ASH
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from Mahesh?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; If GSW goes elsewhere, I see her as handling ATS and
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perhaps AACC (clinchem).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    2. Gregory:
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; Looks like you've got him on the AAP Portal (what is
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that?) with time available; perhaps we can have him
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help us with training, or documentation, in addition
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to putting him on a migration (perhaps BIR)?
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    3. LindaA will be unavailable after ORTHO is done.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    4. Mahesh is overbooked:
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; -- Is INFORMS actually done?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; -- What is the status of AJNR -- substantially complete?
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much time is he spending on that one these days?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; -- The 3 LindaT projects feel like a mess, but I'm not
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sure if that's an argument for keeping him on them or
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; putting someone new into the mix. Thoughts?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; -- ASH (bloodbook) is a mess; I would argue for taking
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him off that one (see above).
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; -- AJS feels like an easy one, but I'm not involved -- do
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you know anything more about it?
    <br />
    <br />
    <font>
     &nbsp;&nbsp; -- ATS is complicated and off to a bad start; I've done
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more to move it forward in the last 24 hours than has
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; either the PbM or the PjM; we need a HWP-experienced
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PjM on this one:
     <font>
      <b>
       <font>
        Ellen, Lydia, you, or me.
        <font>
        </font>
       </font>
      </b>
      <font>
       Part of the
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problem is that it's a Greg customer, and he is a real
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; challenge to manage all by himself.
       <font>
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; -- BIR needs to start up very soon; perhaps Gregory can
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work on this one with someone like Lydia or you or me
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shadowing?
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        5. Phac:
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; -- JBJS-BR is at 65%: huge and complicated.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; -- biolbull should complete today; is there a debrief
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scheduled for this one?
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; -- ASHA Newsletters have restarted at 20%.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; -- Is Phac better suited for an &quot;easier&quot; project (a la
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AACC (clinchem) or a &quot;harder&quot; one (a la CTSNet)?
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        6. Tien appears to be full up -- she's got STKE, now?

    I'm glad you think it looks fine!
    <br />
    <br />
    I'm sure the reasons for not doing all the projects this way were laid out
    <br />
    for you before; there are, unfortunately, many. Here are a few:
    <br />
    <br />
    1. sites were built differently from one another on H1O, and in most cases
    <br />
    their peculiarities are not documented anywhere
    <br />
    <br />
    2. in most cases, the original builders have long since left HighWire
    <br />
    <br />
    3. each site's set of standard features is not reliably documented; we try
    <br />
    to make up for that by having PbMs fill out the Installables, but in most
    <br />
    cases PbMs have inherited their site from somebody who has long since left
    <br />
    HighWire, so they are often just poking around themselves
    <br />
    <br />
    4. custom site features are not reliably documented; see above
    <br />
    <br />
    5. content workflows vary from site to site, and from era to era within a
    <br />
    site; folks who did crazy crap with the content some time ago have long
    <br />
    since left HighWire
    <br />
    <br />
    6. content quality REALLY varies, sometimes from article to article within
    <br />
    a given issue; see above
    <br />
    <br />
    7. our customers have very different approaches to working with HighWire,
    <br />
    and I will refrain from expressing my opinion about why that is or how we
    <br />
    ended up here; some are easy going, take our advice, and trust us; some
    <br />
    are difficult, critical, adversarial, etc., and it is not possible to take
    <br />
    the &quot;bundled&quot; approach with the latter type of customer
    <br />
    <br />
    It's important to keep in mind that HighWire has been operating since
    <br />
    1995, when the internet was still new, and long before there were more or
    <br />
    less &quot;universal&quot; standards about how to use it. There is a lot of history
    <br />
    (much of it very ugly) built into the sites, as well as into our
    <br />
    relationships with our customers.
    <br />
    <br />
    Taking a more directive approach to these migrations would have been super
    <br />
    awesome, and I'm sure we could have done better than we did, but we didn't
    <br />
    go that route for the reasons listed above, and probably others of which
    <br />
    I'm unaware.
    <br />
    <br />
    Anyway.
    <br />
    <br />
    Yes, the same QA teams (internal and Musikaar) are used for bundled
    <br />
    projects.
    <br />
    <br />
    I agree that it would be helpful to get the QA test suites squared away;
    <br />
    that's Rama's job, but I believe he has been tasked with higher priority
    <br />
    projects during the last six months. For better or worse. FWIW, we had no
    <br />
    QA teams at all until late last year, so even though it still kinda sucks,
    <br />
    it's so much better than it was it's not even funny. If you have specific
    <br />
    concerns, perhaps we can set up a meeting with Rama when he gets back from
    <br />
    India to discuss them.

     and he reports to Margo. The reason we're not taking this on within the
     <br />
     PMO is that PjMs are needed for the more complicated projects. Bundles are

     assumed to be (A) easy sites for (B) easy customers.

     Hi Angie,
     <br />
     <br />
     This looks fine, and in the direction of what I was advocating when I
     <br />
     first started: one small dedicated team in charge of the whole process
     <br />
     from A-Z. I assume it also includes the same QA team to make sure the
     <br />
     knowledge is leveraged. The simplification of the back and forth with the
     <br />
     customer is a great idea. It would help to have a full assessment of the
     <br />
     QA test suites to make sure we check at least the known bugs that have
     <br />
     been found recently by publishers in other migrations.
     <br />
     <br />
     In addition, I have a question: Why not have one PjM manage all the bundle
     <br />
     migrations at the same time? There needs to be one person to oversee the
     <br />
     whole process. Would that be Margo?

        Hi Phac,
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm sure you're not the only one who is new to this concept; I'm not 100%
        <br />
        on it myself.
        <br />
        <br />
        In a nutshell, the primary goal of a bundled migration is to reduce the
        <br />
        amount of back and forth we have with the customer. A secondary goal (and
        <br />
        frankly, the one I'm most interested in here) is to remove the PMO from
        <br />
        the project entirely. Bundled migrations are managed by Margo's &quot;migration
        <br />
        team&quot; of developers, along with the PbMs. PjMs are not involved. This
        <br />
        would free you up for a project that cannot be bundled.
        <br />
        <br />
        The major differences between a bundled migration and a standard migration
        <br />
        can be seen when you compare the milestone targets of the two types:

                 The biggest differences are that we (A) don't ask the customer for design
                 <br />
                 input, and (B) don't ask the customer to review sample content. There are
                 <br />
                 also differences in timing of all the moving parts.
                 <br />
                 <br />
                 Let me know if that makes sense and/or if you'd like to discuss further.

                 <br />
                 <br />
                 This is probably obvious to everyone but me, but could you please explain
                 <br />
                 in a few words what is behind the concept of bundled migration? i assume
                 <br />
                 this is to shorten the schedule or reduce the amount of resources
                 <br />
                 required, but does this also mean we limit the amount of QA overall?
                 <br />
                 Thanks for your help.

  <br />
  I'm frankly concerned that we keep adding new PjMs to the mix without
  <br />
  <font>
   proper oversight;
   <font>
    hearing from LindaT yesterday that it was Rich's fault
    <br />
    that three of her projects are now behind schedule -- especially since I
    <br />
    asked Mahesh for status two weeks ago and he said they were all on
    <br />
    schedule -- makes me think we need to do something differently.
    <br />
    <br />
    Do you have one-on-one meetings with new PjMs to do status updates on a
    <br />
    weekly basis? If not, should we implement something like that? I know I'm
    <br />
    supposedly the migration 'maven,' but I'm not a people manager so I've
    <br />
    hesitated to insert myself into anybody's schedule like that. However, it
    <br />
    seems like somebody's gotta do it. Let me know if that somebody should be
    <br />
    me.
    <br />
    <br />
    Do we need to formally assign experienced PjMs to shadow new ones? I think
    <br />
    that LydiaB has been working with Mahesh on the three GSW mirror sites I
    <br />
    referenced above, but even she was unable to prevent this date change, it
    <br />
    would seem.
    <br />
    <br />
    Anyway, I think my preference would be to talk with you about how to stop
    <br />
    up whatever gaps are currently causing problems and then move on from
    <br />
    there to where we're going to add Gregory to the mix, and whether Tien
    <br />
    should take on STKE. (That's another one that I'm concerned about: Margo
    <br />
    told me last week that there were problems with RSMP that Tien should have
    <br />
    done something about, but that because she's new she let them slide. I
    <br />
    should have rejoined the RSMP project after returning from vacation, I
    <br />
    think; when I asked Tien for an update, she said it was going fine apart
    <br />
    from slow content loading. Apparently it was not.)

    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; 1a. SMPTE Standards
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; nav, search, access control work is still pending
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; 16 Jan target in jeopardy
    <br />
    <br />
    Paul: Craig said he'd do Access Control this week. It's
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purely H2O work. Nav may wait until after launch.
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Search is looking better.
    <br />
    <br />
    Margo: Tien told MarkJ yesterday that SMPTE was not happy
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about not having navigation. They would rather change
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the launch date to the 23rd. They have a
    <b>
     <font>
      hard date of
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a review of the 31st.
     </font>
    </b>
    <font>
     <br />
     <br />
     Bill: What about nav is special?
     <br />
     <br />
     Paul:
     <font>
      They wanted to browse by topic. Now they want a custom
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; display. Doesn't think they want to use search results.
      <font>
       <br />
       <br />
       Margo: Nav: Sudhanshu is working on a
       <font>
        VJ feed similar to
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NeoReviews.

         Feed was supposed to be done on Thursday.

         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ian was going to work with Gloria on the XSLT work.

         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; &quot;in progress&quot; since 2009?
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; PbM not motivated to keep working on it due to
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lack of customer involvement
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; this project appears to need executive support
         <br />
         <br />
         Bill: This is a B&gt;P front end. No peer review happens with
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the content. It has to get pushed thru and accepted by
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the editor. He's the guy who is not working on it,
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because he's doing research. Nothing to do.
         <br />

         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; figure out what's happening with this one
         <br />
         <br />
         Margo: Scope of work / functionality concerns coming in from
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xia. Team has been focusing on the &quot;lipstick&quot; of the
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; site for a long time. Now customer is asking for new
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; functionality that developer isn't sure we can do.
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Need to get Xia, Phac, GregS, Margo, others in a room
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to identify remaining pieces. John Haggerty is working
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on XSLT already for this project; not clear exactly
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what is being requested.
         <br />

         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; around content loading. In fact, we have other content
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that
         <b>
          <font>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; created by JeffP when he returns next week.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ron: Are we in scope?
          <br />
          <br />
          Margo: Doesn't think so. Customer is hard to pin down, they
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have been changing their mind.
          <font>
           Feels like Phac is
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; saying Yes to customer requests without first getting
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; technical buy-in.
           <font>
            JeffP would

             <br />
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the 25th of Jan. Thinks we need a meeting.
             <br />
             <br />
             Bill: If there is any culpability on our part about the 25th,
             <br />
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we need to solve that. It's an
             <font>
              extremely important
              <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; date.

               Xenia: An update from the content side. Todd thought he was
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blocked from the Drupal work, but he's not. He was
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; looking in prod for content, instead of dev. He's got
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what he needs, now.
               <br />
               <br />
               Margo: There are still concerns on the JD side about the new
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; functionality.

    #605.00 and #605.10 are for migrations only

    #625.00 We can remove this one, since we're not doing OM anymore.
    <br />
    <br />
    #635.00 Site work should be done 1 week before Beta.
    <br />
    <br />
    #635.10 Move this note down to QA area. Not useful for JDs.
    <br />
    <br />
    ADD NEW TASK TO CREATE TASKS FOR 'UNDONES' AFTER KICKOFF
    <br />
    <br />
    #640.00 Change this one to just confirm progress of 'UNDONES'.
    <br />
    <br />
    #660.00 ALPHA PHASE instead of just ALPHA
    <br />
    <br />
    #663.00 Alpha becomes Beta site.
    <br />
    <br />
    #664.00 Alpha becomes Beta --&gt; Beta phase begins.
    <br />
    <br />
    #665.00 Create Site Notes.
    <br />
    <br />
    Paul: This doesn't happen reliably. How can we get PxMs to actually create
    <br />
    Site Notes?
    <br />
    <br />
    Xenia: A reminder to the PxMs? We need customers to sign off on those
    <br />
    things.
    <br />
    <br />
    Paul: Can we change the task owner to PxM so they know it's up to them to
    <br />
    drive this?
    <br />
    <br />
    Xenia: Maybe create new subtasks, one for CA and one for the JD?
    <br />
    <br />
    #666.00 Index issue for searching should happen before Alpha Phase QA.
    <br />
    <br />
    #666.00 PxM should confirm issue indexing during Site Notes creation.
    <br />
    <br />
    #667.00 This really should happen before Alpha Phase QA. Happen with apply
    <br />
    site design, install features, etcc.
    <br />
    <br />
    #667.00 PxM should also confirm alerts review is complete during Site
    <br />
    Notes.
    <br />
    <br />
    #667.10 Should be mig-only.
    <br />
    <br />
    #675.00 We won't CREATE Beta site here any longer; instead, we'll enable
    <br />
    customer access to Beta site here.
    <br />
    <br />
    Paul: Can we create Content and Dev sites when we create Beta?
    <br />
    <br />
    Xenia: Recollection that there was some reason to have just one instance
    <br />
    until codebase stabilizes (after Alpha Phase / Internal QA).
    <br />
    <br />
    Paul: Let's just create everything at once and then update after Beta.
    <br />
    <br />
    #675.10 Should be removed altogether.
    <br />
    <br />
    #680.00 Should be moved up near site creation:
    <br />
    <br />
    * Assure Beta and Content sites remain up during migration.

    <br />
    <br />
    #930.00 We need more than 24 days to load content. At least 4 weeks should
    <br />
    be standard, with a completion date of 2-3 weeks prior to launch as our
    <br />
    target.
    <br />
    <br />
    #1010.00 Should happen ~9 weeks before launch!
    <br />
    <br />
    #1040.00 Should happen ~7 weeks before launch, not ~4 weeks!
    <br />
    <br />
    ADD LAUNCH TASK TO SWITCH TO WORKFLOW DAY OF LAUNCH
    <br />
    <br />
    ADD BOTH TASK TO EXPLAIN TO CUSTOMER WHAT HAPPENS DURING LAST 2 WEEKS, RE
    <br />
    BUGS VS SHOWSTOPPERS ETC.

    Hello all,
    <br />
    <br />
    Today we began our review of the existing launch schedule template, which
    <br />
    can be found here (intermingled with migration tasks):
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    <a href="https://www.quickbase.com/db/bdhwp9yqi?a=q&amp;qid=1">
     https://www.quickbase.com/db/bdhwp9yqi?a=q&amp;qid=1
    </a>
    <br />
    <br />
    Items marked 'both' or 'launches only' in the 'applies to' column are the
    <br />
    ones we focused on today.
    <br />
    <br />
    Items identified below as not relevant for launches will be changed from
    <br />
    &quot;both&quot; to &quot;migrations only&quot; at this point. Angie will be updating schedule
    <br />
    template. We'll meet again tomorrow morning to complete our review.
    <br />
    <br />
    Thanks,
    <br />
    Angie
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    Initial Questions:
    <br />
    <br />
    1. What prompts the Project Initialization phase?
    <br />
    2. Who is involved with development of the LOA?
    <br />
    3. Who decides target launch dates?
    <br />
    4. Do PbMs use schedule templates?
    <br />
    5. Who creates new Next_100 entries?
    <br />
    <br />
    All: We need a new set of Project Prerequisites that are geared toward
    <br />
    launches. All tasks in that phase right now are for migrations, only.
    <br />
    <br />
    Xenia: Doesn't think PbMs confer with Bill (at least)
    <font>
     about target launch
     <br />
     dates.
     <font>
      Perhaps PbMs are still using the H1O assumptions (here's my date,
      <br />
      let's make it happen) that don't work well in the modern era.
      <br />
      <br />
      Xenia: Thinks that PbMs notify some people on the mgmt team (Bill and
      <br />
      others) letting them know some details about the launch, often including
      <br />
      the launch DATE (not good), and requesting resources (content, site).
      <br />
      However, there
      <font>
       doesn't seem to be an official process in place.
       <font>
        <br />
        <br />
        Angie: Perhaps Tien and Ron have some info on how the PbMs work on
        <br />
        launches? I'll ask. We should try to get PbM input on how these projects
        <br />
        get started.
        <br />
        <br />
        **ACTION: Angie to follow up with Tien and Ron.
        <br />
        <br />
        **ACTION: Angie to query MarkJ about which member(s) of his org can be
        <br />
        consulted re: how PbMs work on new launches.
        <br />
        <br />
        Before #205.00, we need a task to create Next_100 launch set record. We'd
        <br />
        like the PbMs to take this on. Do they have access/privs?
        <br />
        <font>
         <br />
         **ACTION: Angie to query Bernard for details.
         <font>
          <br />
          <br />
          #205.00 Contact Kathryn for jcodes.
          <br />
          <br />
          **ACTION: Xenia to work with content team to make sure that &quot;jcode rules&quot;
          <br />
          are known. That info will then be incorporated as a note.
          <br />
          <br />
          Xenia: Is it possible for PbMs to change target dates without anybody else
          <br />
          being notified?
          <br />
          <font>

            <br />
            <br />
            #215.00 REQUEST AND confirm resource assignments. Include roles.
            <br />
            <br />
            #230.00 WORK WITH CUSTOMER TO CONFIRM design decisions.
            <br />
            <br />
            #231.00 Change from select design to template design in QuickBase.
            <br />
            <br />
            #232.00 Ref Style should be part of the DIGs call. Move.
            <br />
            <br />
            #250.00 Change &quot;Undones&quot; to &quot;Custom Work&quot; or &quot;Custom Enhancements&quot;.
            <br />
            <br />
            #250.10 Reword to remove &quot;Undones&quot; terminology.
            <br />
            <br />
            #300.00 H1O Site Analysis will be eliminated.
            <br />
            <br />
            #380.00 (Article Template) will move to a later point in the process.
            <br />
            <br />
            #400.00 Project Setup phase.
            <br />
            <br />
            Paul: Wants to get rid of Alpha sites completely. They don't add any
            <br />
            value. Exactly the same as the Beta site except in terms of naming
            <br />
            structure. When we switch from A to B, we're just renaming the site.
            <br />
            Without them, we don't have to create an extra set of URLs. Alpha review
            <br />
            turns into Internal review, Beta review turns into External review.
            <br />
            <br />
            Xenia: Naming conventions may be important. Alpha and Beta are pretty
            <br />
            standard in a project lifecycle. Any idea why we started out with Alpha
            <br />
            and Beta? Perhaps we wanted to make sure the Alpha was entirely invisible
            <br />
            to the customer?
            <br />
            <br />
            All: Let's ditch Alpha sites:
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Phases: Alpha, Beta;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Production
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp; Sites:&nbsp; Beta, Content; Dev, Production
            <br />
            <br />
            #410.00 MDDB feels like it's not getting done, at least not consistently.
            <br />
            <br />
            Paul: Can something (maybe entry in MDDB) trigger delivery of project
            <br />
            prereq info to project team? PbM needs to fill this out before JDs
            <br />
            can build the site.
            <br />
            <br />
            Xenia: Can we make MDDB interface easier for PbMs to use? Who controls
            <br />
            that interface?
            <br />
            <font>
             <br />
             Angie: Maybe Data Warehouse?
             <font>
              <br />
              <br />
              Paul: Maybe instead of changing interface we just give PbMs a checklist of
              <br />
              things to include?
              <br />
              <br />
              Xenia: Let's create a parking lot of &quot;to do&quot; items and park this one in
              <br />
              it. We need to keep thinking about MDDB.
              <br />
              <br />
              #420.00 Customer's password should be added to QuickBase. Should happen as
              <br />
              early as possible since it goes to Dave Vernon for setup.
              <br />
              <br />
              #420.10 Can be removed.
              <br />
              <br />
              #430.00 Initialize H2O site should happen before kickoff. (And it does.)
              <br />
              <font>
               <br />
               Paul: Again, JDs need something to tell them to do this task before the
               <br />
               kickoff. What can trigger that?
               <br />
               <br />
               **ACTION: Angie to discuss with Bernard.
               <br />
               <font>
                <br />
                #430.10 and #430.20 should be removed.
                <br />
                <br />
                #431.00 thru #434.00 should be removed.
                <br />
                <br />
                #440.00 can be combined with #430.00 since they are interrelated.
                <br />
                <br />
                #470.00 should stay.
                <br />
                <br />
                #495.00 draft project schedule should happen earlier than this.
                <br />
                <br />
                Paul: Before resource assignment requests.
                <br />
                <br />
                #496.00 should also move, to just after project schedule.
                <br />
                <br />
                #505.00 becomes first task in Project Launch phase.
                <br />
                <br />
                #511.00 Names should change to roles. No A/C rep anymore.
                <br />
                <br />
                Angie: At what point does CA learn what the content is going to be?
                <br />
                <br />
                Xenia: Very high-level info passed along at the time assignment is made.
                <br />
                (PDF-only workflow, no content yet, 5 volumes of fulltext, etc.)
                <br />
                <br />
                #512.00 and #513.00 should be removed.
                <br />
                <br />
                #514.00 should stay.
                <br />
                <br />
                #514.10 should be removed.
                <br />
                <br />
                #535.00 final project schedule should happen later, after DIGs call.
                <br />
                <br />
                #536.00 should be task about ref style (now task #232.00). Add note
                <br />
                #536.10, customer should be asked during DIGs call to select ref style
                <br />
                they want. Add note #536.20 for CA to request samples during DIGs call.
                <br />
                Add task #537.00 for CA to receive samples within 2 weeks of DIGs call.
                <br />
                <br />
                #545.00 note should happen when final schedule is prepared (#535.00).
                <br />
                We don't need schedule in Google Docs.
                <br />
                <br />
                All: We'll resume this discussion at 11am tomorrow with item #600.00: Beta
                <br />
                Site Development.
                <br />

                <br />
                <br />
                B. Are there any outstanding journal migrations that we can
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp; go ahead and schedule at this time? Journal sites that
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp; are still living on H1O but are not yet firmly scheduled
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp; for migration include the following:
                <br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. JWatch (jwacc, jwcard, jwderm, jwem, jwfwatch,
                <br />

  Rama,

  <br />
  Most of these punchlist items were initially reported by the customer. So I do think that in most cases, they will need
  <br />
  to live in SalesForce. And then be generated in JIRA as well (for internal prioritization and action). We can certainly do
  <br />
  that, once those 2 tools are ready for prime time.

 Even though we have not fully migrated to Jira, I suggest for these pending punch list tasks, entering them directly in Jira may be beneficial. Quickbase to Salesforce and thence to Jira can be avoided for these recent (less than 1 year) punch list tasks.
  <br />
  <br />
  Sara's experience with Jira is quite positive.

  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; effort is not too onerous, she may be willing to
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help PbMs with this, as well, but as a first step
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thinks we should focus on having the PbSs lend a

  Update on ASHASIG content loading (item #4g). The content massage was completed earlier this week, and
  <br />
  content loading is in progress. It is slated to complete tomorrow, or by Monday -- if we keep that on track, we'll
  <br />
  end up ahead of schedule.

  Hello all,
  <br />
  <br />
  Here are my notes from today's call. ACTION items are called out inline.
  <br />
  Additions and corrections are welcome.

  <br />
  Thanks,

  1. OUP Journals Umbrella migration
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - significant time requirement from LisaW?
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - in progress, or not yet?
  <br />
  <br />
  Xenia: E-mail from Dharm re
  <b>
   <font>
    : voucher problem(s
   </font>
  </b>
  <font>
   ).
   <br />
   <br />
   Margo: Greg is looking into it now. If it can be
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resolved on H1O site, migration becomes
   <b>
    <font>
     less
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; critical
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    . If it can't, migration becomes more
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urgent.
    <br />
    <br />
    Margo: Either Karen or LisaW would do migration if
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; migration is needed. Can probably take what
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we did for the GSW Portal (the way it's been
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; broken down) and apply to OUP. Doesn't think
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it will be a terribly big project.
    <br />
    <br />
    ** ACTION: Margo to clarify next steps with Greg and
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the OUP team.

     All: We'll talk to Ellen about this after GSW, and it
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should be safe to kickoff in early Jan.

     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to keep or go standard?

         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obviate need for it altogether. We'll need to
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wait and see.

         <br />
         Margo: JeffP estimates he will have it installed in
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prod by the end of November. Note from Nancy
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gough which seemed to indicate RelMgr would
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be done yesterday.

     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margo: Did have a kickoff. LydiaB is managing,
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; separate from normal process. Should we
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fold her launches in here?
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xenia: Tien, Tom, and other directors are now
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; talking about processes, including
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; launch.
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margo: Although resource pool for BMJ is
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; different, it might be good to have all
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; projects in one place. However, for
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certain processes (e.g. OUP launches,
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SAGE launches) a Next_100 component
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; might be seen as new overhead.
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angie: Has experienced resource contention on
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the JD and systems side for OUP-Books,
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which are not tracked in Next_100; that
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; launch process probably impacts others,
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in turn.
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All: Let's revisit once we have moved from
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QuickBase to Salesforce and JIRA to see
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how we might use one or the other new tool
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to better manage resources, including for
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; large publishers that have dedicated teams.

  Hello all,
  <br />
  <br />
  Here are my notes from our morning session; ACTION items have been
  <br />
  included inline. Additions and corrections are welcome.
  <br />

  --------------------
  <br />
  <br />
  1. Debriefing re: bundled QA process, findings?
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Walked thru process with Rama, identified
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; things that were missed, many had to do with
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relative timing of migration work vs when
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; things are QAd. Rama will be writing up a
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; summary.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Seems like we didn't anticipate the level of
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feedback.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Yes, end of the process was chaotic. Also,
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; something reported broken for Duke is still
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; broken, and was reported as part of the
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bundle.
  <br />
  <br />
  **ACTION: Rama or Paul to circulate list of findings
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to team.
  <br />
  <br />

  <br />
  2. ACLS migration
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - kickoff ~14 Dec
  <br />
  3. AACR Virtual Journals migration
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - kickoff ~28 Dec
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Should we kick these off in Jan 2012, so that
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we don't schedule work during the end-of-year
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blackout?
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Did we commit to starting work on either in
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2011? Perhaps we should discuss with Bill.
  <br />
  <br />
  **ACTION: Angie to add to 2pm agenda.

  4. Update on umbrella migrations?
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - Simpler:
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- aacrjnls (#293)
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- cshljnls (#303
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - Harder:
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- dupjnls (#304)
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- oupjournals (#135)
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Still need to staff these. FYI, GSW is
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pretty much staffed.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; XS: FAQ for migration prepared by LindaT,
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; April 2012 is the date she is planning to
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tell the customer.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Will circulate GSW Portal plan to the
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; group; very technical project, need to
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identify PjM.
  <br />
  <br />
  **ACTION: Paul will staff umbrella migrations.
  <br />
  <br />
  **ACTION: Margo will circulate GSW Portal plan to
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the group.

  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Concerns about ASM asking for custom
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work, changing their mind, expecting
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes to be implemented free of charge.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: Doesn't sense that this will be a

  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may be able to deal with it on the UI

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; side.

  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; next steps.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Anything content related?
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Not so much. Links missing, logos not in
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place, more site and UI stuff is pending.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Meeting with Sara this morning to check

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --
  <font>
   Gregory may need help determining what to
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fix, where to push back; he may have met
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with Bernard on this, A. will check in
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with him on Weds
   <font>
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Feels like Gregory is letting JDs and CA
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drive the feedback process.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Alan can push back, but sometimes jumps
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in and fixes things.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Same with Xia; she may just fix things in
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; order to move on.
    <br />
    <br />

    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Feels like Phac is not really focused on
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this one; Xia is driving the technical
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work and development concerns.

     : Kathryn volunteered to take the lead to put
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; together a strategy document
     <font>
      ; once that's
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drafted and discussed, we can put together a
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; schedule.
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Perhaps a single PjM can handle all of these
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if we have an actual strategy document.
      <br />

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; development?
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; MK: During roadmap meeting, Kathryn and Craig
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were clear that the H2O books platform
      <font>
       needs
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be &quot;fixed&quot; for the existing books before
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we migrate the rest of them.
       <font>
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Is the plan not to migrate the books until we
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have the platform sorted out?
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Todd suggested leaving Red Book where it is
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until we sort out the platform.

    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: How are we closing feedback loop with
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rama's team?

    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Are we going to go live with sites for
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; publishers that don't provide feedback,
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without explicit written approval?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: For one site - Ellen's - we don't expect
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any feedback, so we might go ahead.
    <br />

    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - ssabull
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: CSS bug is preventing author names from
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; displaying on TOC for certain types of
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content encoding.

    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Believes we're on track.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Certain links to PubMed won't work on H2O.
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will be fixed just after migration so that
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H1O links continue to work in the meantime.

    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - GSW (w/o portal umbrella)
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Still moving along, what's the status of
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content loading / threads?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Limiting factor won't be thread count, but
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bandwidth of the CA to fix any problems
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that emerge during loading (via HWX). Put
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another resource on this. There might be
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another bottleneck with H2O / HWX Triage
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people.

    <br />
    **ACTION: XENIA WILL DISCUSS WITH BILL/KATHRYN.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: What are we doing in terms of QA on these
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sites?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Decided to do limited QA on GeoRef era.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Site stuff in-hand?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Yes, we're in good shape. Very little left
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to do.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Doing staging site approach?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Yes.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Since we can't create the staging sites
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until content complete, are we going to
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have enough time?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Getting the staging sites up won't take
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Should discuss offline whether there are
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; restrictions on development of staging
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sites prior to content complete.

    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Went to kickoff and Phac seemed a bit
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confused; to begin, he was using the
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrong schedule; also didn't make it all
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the way through the schedule during the
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meeting.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: This is an at-risk customer, has been
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meeting with Tom Rump, our internal QA
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will be critical.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: There is extensive QA built into the
    <br />

    <br />

    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Q: Do we want to keep Next_100 for launches, or
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should we find a different tool?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Directors not intending to move away from
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QB. Can we at least change the name?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Next_100 does work well for admin purposes.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; PB: We should revisit the launch process in
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; general.

  0. QA
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - Review of QA issues, discussion(s)
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; XS: We met with Ron internally last week, then with Neha/Musikaar directly. The meeting went well,
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they were open to feedback. Decided to have a&nbsp;&nbsp; call once a month or so.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  -----------------
  <br />
  1. Bundled migrations
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - Current status
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - Absentee PbMs
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - Handling feedback
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; - Escalation
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Believes that all the PbMs should have released&nbsp;&nbsp; Beta sites to their customers by now.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: As a reminder, these journals were bundled for&nbsp;&nbsp; a reason: for the most part, they are customers&nbsp; who might not care as much as some others.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: A few - haematol, annalsfm, pdi - will probably&nbsp;&nbsp; be looking more closely at the sites.
  <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS/PB: Probably worth it to confirm with PbMs that&nbsp; Betas have been released.
  <br />
  <font>
   <br />
   **ACTION: AdeV TO CONFIRM WITH PBMs TODAY.
   <font>
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Note that Ellen has done hers, also Greg.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Will set up Google Spreadsheet for addition of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; non-showstopper items.
    <br />
    <br />
    <font>
     **ACTION: PB TO SET UP GOODOC SHEET AND DISTRIBUTE TO
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ALL PARTIES (PBMs, XS, AdeV).
     <font>
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <font>
       AdeV: Will serve as PbM pro tem for Greg and LindaT; other PbMs will funnel feedback to either the&nbsp; GooDoc (for non-showstoppers) or via e-mail&nbsp; to migbundle@highwire (for showstoppers).
       <font>
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Will work with AdeV and PB to review both types&nbsp; of feedback and help escalate to directors, as&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: For any serious feedback, we *can* pull them&nbsp; out of the bundle if necessary.
        <br />

        <br />
        2. Status on active migrations
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; - 3 Geo Sites launching today (econgeo, jsedres,
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; palaios); status request pending with Mahesh
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Launching tomorrow, not today. One wasn't
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; complete complete as of yesterday (palaios?).
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Will be following up with content today.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Had prelaunch meeting yesterday. One had its
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mapping scripts run yesterday. Some A/C
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problems have been resolved.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: econgeo is content complete.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: econgeo site is also ready to go.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: UPDATE DURING MEETING: econgeo, palaios are
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content complete, jsedres is 90% and should be
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100% today.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: CA should alert JD so that mapping can begin.
        <br />
        <font>
         <br />
         **ACTION: XS TO MAKE SURE CA KEEPS JD IN THE LOOP.

          <br />
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp; - 1 Geo Site launching next week; as above
          <br />
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: ssabull not yet content complete, and there&nbsp; are problems. Target date is 13 Oct; while&nbsp; the date is not in jeopardy, there is a flag.&nbsp; SMPTE has same CA as this one, so MikeM needs help; a second CA has been assigned.
          <b>
           <font>
            We won't&nbsp;&nbsp; have a 1-week cushion between content&nbsp;&nbsp; complete and go-live.

           <br />
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Not yet. Working VERY hard to keep target&nbsp;&nbsp; date.

             <br />
             <br />
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Phac may not realize that Xia has been loading
             <br />
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DS for all migrations all along,
             <font>
              it's not a big

              <font>
               . She says she's fine. JeffP is
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a much bigger problem. Is hoping to find a way
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to move him off the BIR migration, at least.
               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: Do we have a project scope for this one, yet?
               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: GregS is doing the technical JD work associated
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the project; he's on top of it. PB will
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; start becoming involved on the management level,&nbsp; only.
               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: The BJR launch happens in October; 2 migrations
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and a launch in January. End of Oct launch has
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no content. A lot of meetings to date have been&nbsp; with Craig and Todd.
               <br />
               <br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: Phac is concerned that the JD is not working
               <br />

   1. Communication with PbMs about bundled migrations
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; Summary: Some PbMs appear not to have discussed the
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bundled approach with their customers;
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; getting a &quot;head-count&quot; on that now. MPP and
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MA were not distributed to PbMs, so none of
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bundled customers have those docs as of
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; today.
   <br />
   <font>
    <br />
    AdV: got OK from PbMs, and prepared documentation was not shared. At least 1 PbM hasn't talked to the customer - so others might be aware.
    <br />
    PB: I talked to all except Dom, everybody else had given heads up to publishers.
    <br />
    Only one that weren't notified were Linda T

     2. Project plan for ASHA Newsletters
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; Summary: Schedule is being built, with a proposed
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; launch date of 8 December. This project
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will need a dedicated manager, either PbM
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or PjM. (Aside: Angie/Bernard have
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tentatively identified PjM.)
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; Suggested (&quot;quasi-bundled&quot;) approach:
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - no alpha sites
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - start with beta sites, pointed to prod
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - load pan-era samples to prod, subset of sites
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - QA site, features, and content, as per &quot;alpha&quot;
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - fix bugs
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - load pan-era samples to prod, all sites
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - ask Musikaar to QA content only, unless we find
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out that the sites are not &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; in
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of design/features
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - give ASHA access ~2 weeks prior to launch; ask
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them to review and finalize File Manager pages at
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that time
     <br />
     <font>
      <br />
      ashajnls beta/prod.... 100% content QA
      <br />
      will be Phac
      <br />
      GregB, X, P, A to talk today
      <br />
      #18 is the model. That told us what the important items are, ex., citation format
      <br />
      PB: to check w/Xia if the sites are really cookie cutter.
      <br />
      Pam W will take these over from Greg B (and the journals from Christine)

       3. CTSNet reality check
       <br />
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Summary: Due to the scope of the CTSNet project and
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resource (staffing) constraints, it seems

             <br />
             Moving CME (now under CTS a/c db)&nbsp; to Sage will be big deal. We'll have to bring up a new, clean OUP/Sage umbrella.
             <br />
             <br />
             CME 2.0 (i.e., BW and LH) will handle this migration better.

                          <br />
                          XPS: Portal is big hairy, we decided earlier to convert the portal AFTER the sites migration
                          <br />
                          BW: LT has agreement that we do the facelift (headers/ footers, colors only). Alex@GSW concern is that we'll take forever to finish the H2O version of the portal. LT told him Q2.
                          <br />
                          BUT it's all FEATURES on that portal. We have to inventory them, and think about the development work.
                          <br />
                          Needs to be Sara, b/c only she does H1O. But Lorena's brother does DTL design (seattle; see BW)

   1. Communication with PbMs about bundled migrations
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; Summary: Some PbMs appear not to have discussed the
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bundled approach with their customers;
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; getting a &quot;head-count&quot; on that now. MPP and
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MA were not distributed to PbMs, so none of
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bundled customers have those docs as of
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; today.
   <br />
   <br />
   Paul: Hasn't yet heard back from Dom, but talked to all
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other PbMs. All PbMs except for LindaT are fine.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They're aware, publishers are either OK or don't
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; care.
   <br />
   <br />
   Angie: radtech and clinmedres are LindaT's bundled
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sites; two different publishers.
   <br />
   <br />
   Bill: If PbM doesn't think MPP/MA is necessary, safe
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to skip.
   <br />
   <br />
   <b>
    <font>
     ACTION
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    : Paul and Xenia will meet with LindaT to discuss
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her concerns. Will try to keep them on the same
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; schedule, otherwise her two sites will have a
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; separate schedule.
    <br />
    <br />
    ACTION: Paul will follow up with Dom, as well.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    2. Project plan for ASHA Newsletters
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Summary: Schedule is being built, with a proposed
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; launch date of 8 December. This project
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will need a dedicated manager, either PbM
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or PjM. (Aside: Angie/Bernard have
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tentatively identified PjM.)
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Suggested (&quot;quasi-bundled&quot;) approach:
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - no alpha sites
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - start with beta sites, pointed to prod
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - load pan-era samples to prod, subset of sites
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - QA site, features, and content, as per &quot;alpha&quot;
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - fix bugs
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - load pan-era samples to prod, all sites
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - ask Musikaar to QA content only, unless we find
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out that the sites are not &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; in
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of design/features
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - give ASHA access ~2 weeks prior to launch; ask
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them to review and finalize File Manager pages at
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that time
    <br />
    <br />
    ACTION: Angie will prepare schedule.
    <br />
    <br />
    ACTION: Paul, Xenia, and Angie will meet with GregB to
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confirm this approach prior to kickoff.
    <br />
    <br />
    Paul: Also gave GregB a heads-up on this today.
    <br />
    <br />
    Xenia: Should we build time into the schedule in case
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they decide to do a major review at the end?
    <br />
    <br />
    Mark: If we &quot;match 18&quot; we'll be OK.
    <br />
    <br />
    Bill: We do have a list of the things that they really
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; care about, so we need to focus on those things
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; during QA.
    <br />
    <br />
    Bernard: Phac will be PjM.
    <br />
    <br />
    Mark: Pam will take this customer from Greg.
    <br />
    <font>
     <br />
     ACTION: Angie and Bernard will bring Phac into the loop
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; once schedule has been drafted.

      <br />
      3. CTSNet reality check
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Summary: Due to the scope of the CTSNet project and
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resource (staffing) constraints, it seems
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extremely unlikely that we will be able to
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; squeeze this migration in during 2011, even
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if CTSNet/Dom comes back with a green-light
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; next week.
      <br />
      <br />
      Angie: There are four sites involved, plus CME.
      <br />
      <br />
      Mark: Transition from Polly to Dom was announced last
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; week.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: In order to keep CME, the SAGE site needs to
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remain under CTSNet umbrella.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: Let's continue to wait on Dom's report, which he
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will need to secure from CTSNet.
      <br />
      <br />
      Mark: Dom does know that he is supposed to get this
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; info for us ASAP. Dom met with Polly on this last
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; week.
      <br />
      <br />
      Ron: Someone should follow up with Dom.
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: Mark will follow up with Dom.
      <br />
      <br />
      Mark: Is there a date by which we need to decide go/no-go?
      <br />
      <br />
      Xenia: It has already passed.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      <br />
      4. Other migration-y items of note
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 4a. AJNR had some problems; debrief?
      <br />
      <br />
      Bernard: PbM was away during a period of high activity.
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The customer contact has been very difficult
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to work with. A secondary contact at AJNR is
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more rational. Feedback has been somewhat
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arbitrary. As of today there are still some
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open items.
      <br />
      <br />
      Paul: We thought this was going to be a simple
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; migration, but ended up doing heavy customization
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the UI side. Bottleneck with Sara. Problems
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; during the launch itself. Paul set up the
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prelaunch meeting himself; PjM didn't do it.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bernard: DTL quizzes had problems as of launch day.
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: None (?)
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 4b. JBJSBR may have a resource constraint: JD
      <br />
      <br />
      Bernard: We need external validation of this; the PjM
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may not be aware of HighWire's &quot;status quo&quot;.
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The JD side should review.
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: Paul will do a sanity-check with Xia.
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 4c. ASM has a resource constraint: Sara
      <br />
      <br />
      Group: She is over-committed, &quot;totally crushed.&quot;
      <br />
      <br />
      Mark: ASM has just transitioned from Fran to Bert, but
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he has no bandwith really to do anything for ASM.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: If Sara has to do both GSW Portal and ASM File
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manager pages, which should go first? Need to
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; figure it out.
      <br />
      <br />
      Ron: GSW is H1O, so it's not as easy to hand stuff off
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to others.
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: (See #5, below.)
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 4d. AAP may have a resource constraint: Sudhanshu
      <br />
      <br />
      Ron: Craig said he would have some start/end dates for
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; us by Friday.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: Is this really that big of a project? Didn't WARP
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reveal that this wasn't a big project?
      <br />
      <br />
      Ron: It seems like we finish something, call it done,
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and then identify something else that's still
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; undone.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: Let's see what Sudhanshu says on Friday.
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: Ron will follow up with Sudhanshu.
      <br />
      <br />

      <br />
      5. GSW portal work in 2011 vs 2012
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - headers, footers, colors only in 2011
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - Sara's time to do the development?
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - any other resources required from JD, CA, or PMO?
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - when do we start scoping, staffing, and scheduling
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the actual portal work?
      <br />
      <br />
      Xenia: Was told by LindaT/Margo earlier this year that
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the portal is a sizable project; for that reason
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we decided to split the journals from the portal
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and do the portal later. Not sure how/why it
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resurfaced now.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: Talked with LindaT this morning. LindaT has an
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agreement with Alix that we will do this facelift
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in 2011 (keep it in H1O for now). Alix's concern
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is &quot;the tail&quot;. Is it going to be finished in 2012?
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier? Later? LindaT is looking for a date, and
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill thinks maybe Q2 2012 is feasible. Suggested
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that she sit down with JD team to review features
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to decide how to migrate the portal next year.
      <br />
      <br />
      Paul: So we are committed to headers/footers/colors in
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2011. Has to be Sara to do the work.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bernard: Any external resources available to help?
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: Lorena's brother did &quot;stunningly marvelous&quot; work
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for us on some DTL/CME work. His name is Joe.
      <br />
      <br />
      Ron: Greg has had a conversation with LindaT already.
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: Paul will discuss Sara's schedule with GregS
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; next week.
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: Mark will follow up with LindaT for additional
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; background.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      <br />
      6. 2012 project priorities
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - stke: in progress now?
      <br />
      <br />
      Mark: Had a meeting with AAAS yesterday. Polly is going
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to draft spec for H2O migration of STKE with a
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drupal layer on it. Should be done in ~2 weeks.
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They'll have ~2 weeks to review it.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: Tien is the PjM, and she seems to have a good
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; handle on this one. Has a good strategy. Will be
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; working on this with Polly.
      <br />
      <br />
      Mark: Polly will be doing a brain dump on AAAS with
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X (did not hear) and Christine.
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - jwatch: any updates?
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: We should find out something soon -- at least a
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; week, maybe more. Don't have a schedule, yet.
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - cme sites (mobile)
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: Two are in production, others are close to being
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in production. Sometime in 2012 we will move CME
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sites into the H2O environment. AHA is in final
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beta.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: All the rest of these fall into the same
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; category. We need to decompose all of these.
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - umbrella sites
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: Two different types: ones that &quot;just sit there&quot;
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vs those that are very functional. We need to
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make those determinations.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: PbMs should do this analysis for us.
      <br />
      <br />
      Ron: Do we have a list of umbrellas?
      <br />
      <br />
      Bernard: Margo put one together.
      <br />
      <br />
      Angie: I can include it in the meeting notes.
      <br />
      <br />
      Group: [Further discussion about umbrellas, I think.]
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: Unknown. Not sure if somebody else picked this
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up at the end of the call; it was difficult to
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hear the discussion.
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - meeting abstracts sites
      <br />
      <br />
      --Not Discussed--
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - virtual journals (x2?)
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; - books sites
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; ecarlyle
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; oup (a whole bunch)

      <br />
      <br />
      --Not Discussed--
      <br />
      <br />
      Paul: Any updates on SMPTE Standards?
      <br />
      <br />
      Bill: At least two weeks late in feedback from the
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customer. They've already been told that delays
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on their side result in delays on our side.
      <br />
      <br />
      Mark: Have signed off on November launch.
      <br />
      <br />
      Bernard: Recommends talking to Tien directly.

   0. For our next PAX
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - Review of QA issues, discussion(s)
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - Planning for 2012 projects
   <br />
   <br />
   -----------------
   <br />
   1. Communication with PbMs about bundled migrations
   <br />
   <br />
   Angie: We need to pass info along to PbMs ASAP; at
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this point we don't know whether their
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customers are even available to review in
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; October.
   <br />
   <br />
   Xenia: Worst case scenario, some PbMs may not have
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; told their customers about the bundling.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Paul will walk around the office and confirm
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that customers have been made aware of
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bundled approach with each PbM directly.
   <br />
   <br />
   Xenia: Sounds like a good idea, to meet with each PbM
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; individually.
   <br />
   <br />
   Xenia: MPP/MA may not have been shared with the PbMs.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If they have not been received by the customers,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do we want to deliver those now or not?
   <br />
   <br />
   Angie: Suggests asking a &quot;safe&quot; PbM if they ever
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received the MPP/MA for the bundles; if so,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great, if not, bring to afternoon meeting
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with Bill.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Xenia will talk to Ellen about MPP/MA.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Angie to add to 2pm agenda.
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
   -----------------
   <br />
   2. Project plan for ASHA Newsletters
   <br />
   <br />
   Angie: Need to finalize launch date and schedule.
   <br />
   <br />
   Xenia: If we don't have a dedicated PjM or PbM, then
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as we did for the other bundles we could have
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a combo of JD/CA to manage it, potentially. If
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we take that approach, we'll need a separate
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CA to manage the content side.
   <br />
   <br />
   Paul: JD side doesn't have staff available to manage
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the site side. Needs to go back to Mark or Ron.
   <br />
   <br />
   Paul: Staging site is on a production cluster. It's
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pointing to prod DB, and is essentially live.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has to be instantiated very close to production
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because we can't make changes on a daily basis.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We set them up ~2 weeks prior to migration. Main
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; benefit of staging site is that it goes faster
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than Beta.
   <br />
   <br />
   Paul: If this customer doesn't really care about
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speed, maybe we just don't do Staging sites.
   <br />
   <br />
   Paul: Suggested approach:
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - no alpha sites
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - start with beta sites, pointed to prod
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - load pan-era samples to prod, subset of sites
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - QA site, features, and content, as per &quot;alpha&quot;
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - fix bugs
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - load pan-era samples to prod, all sites
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - ask Musikaar to QA content only, unless we
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; find out that the sites are not &quot;cookie-cutter&quot;
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in terms of design/features
   <br />
   <br />
   Xenia: Sounds good.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Angie to draft schedule using this info.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Angie to identify PjM with Bernard.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Angie to include on 2pm agenda.
   <br />
   <br />
   Paul: Appear to be generated sites; will double-check
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with H1O JD (Xiaoya?). They appear to have a
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shared set of FM pages, so if we convert them
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and pass them along to ASHA ~2 weeks should be
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fine.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Paul to double-check with Xiaoya (?).
   <br />
   <br />
   -----------------
   <br />
   3. Make clear to mgmt that CTSNet won't complete in
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 2011, even if customer decision re: whether to
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; retain umbrella happens in early October
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: Angie to include on 2pm agenda.
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
   -----------------
   <br />
   4. Status on active migrations
   <br />

   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lots of open items at that time; sounds like it
   <br />

   1. ASHA newsletters: to bundle or not to bundle?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; would it trouble (or anger) them if we bundle,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the sense that they may not trust us right
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now, and may wish to check our work as we go?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; do we please them by &quot;doing all the work&quot; by
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bundling?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; shall we ask ASHA their preference, or make the
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decision internally?
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: A draft schedule is now pending with Angie.
   <br />
   <br />
   BW: There was on a call with ASHA today.
   <b>
    <font>
     They don't
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; want to look at anything, ever; they want us to
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get everything 100% correct, and if we don't then
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we're doing it wrong.
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    <br />
    <br />
    RL: Sounded like he expects it to look exactly the
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; same on H2O as it does on H1O.
    <br />
    <br />
    BW: It's not so much the fonts and styling, as much
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the individual bits of content that need to
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look the same, be positioned in the same way as
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as on H1O. The things that ASHA is most
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; concerned about are:
    <b>
     <font>
      author display, title
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; display, section names. Structure.
     </font>
    </b>
    <font>
     <br />
     <br />
     XS: Is a content briefing required here?
     <br />
     <br />
     BW: ASHA gave us a list of things that we need to
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; correct in #18 (launch) before we go live
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tomorrow. If we can solve everything in #18 to
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASHA's satisfaction, we should be able to go
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forward with migration. If HWP sees anything not
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on ASHA's list, we need to call them out for ASHA.
     <br />
     <br />
     XS: Are 1-16 cookie-cutter?
     <br />
     <br />
     BW: Yes. #17 (live) and #18 (pending) are now higher
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; visibility, and ASHA doesn't like what they're
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seeing, so we're going back in to address
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problems on both sites.
     <br />
     <br />
     MK: We are talking about a bundled approach.
     <br />
     <br />
     MJ: This does make it easier for ASHA to pin a
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;failure&quot; on HWP.
     <br />
     <br />
     XS: Few eras, not much content.
     <br />
     <br />
     BW: Yes, bundled approach. ASHA wants it to be done
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100% accurately.
     <br />
     <br />
     MK: Can the when be in January?
     <br />
     <b>
      <font>
       <br />
       BW: No, it has to be in 2011.
      </font>
     </b>
     <font>
      <br />
      <br />
      MK: Who will PjM this one? Perhaps Paul, will take it
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; offline.
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: MK will talk to Paul and others about PjM.
      <br />
      <br />

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QA is happening on alerts.
       <br />
       <br />
       MK: Will PbM be the person to officially sign off on
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sites before we show them to ASHA?
       <br />
       <br />

       <br />
       2. CTSNet: to migrate or not to migrate?
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; Directors appear to have decided to go ahead
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the migration in the absence of a firm
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; commitment
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; PbM (Polly) has strong reservations
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; has no official PjM at this time, but Angie is
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trying to keep moving it forward
       <br />
       <br />
       BW: CTSNet is split in three, now: two are proceeding,
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just no decision about the umbrella and which
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't. The one that's gone to SAGE is in progress.
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three that have gone to OUP are in progress.
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining journals are not in progress. What
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we do with the umbrella or not has not been
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decided.
       <br />
       <br />
       BH: Polly indicates that after annual meeting (in
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; late Sep 2011), we may have more clarity.
       <br />
       <br />
       MJ: Louise covering for Polly, but CTSNet will go to
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dom.
       <br />
       <br />
       BW: CTSNet does need to give us their decisions on
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the umbrella, the associations between the sites,
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the feature set, etc.
       <br />
       <br />
       AdeV: Reminder that two of the CTSNet sites come to
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; us in the Elsevier DTD, will require a custom
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XSL transform, work has begun but is not yet
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; complete. Also, the SAGE journal is currently
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; part of the larger CTSNet launch set, and does
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not have a migration date, yet.
       <br />
       <br />
       BW: How to move forward with that title is a question
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for Bert/SAGE.
       <br />
       <br />
       MJ: Thinks that we should allow CTSNet to have their
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; annual meeting, and that Dom should follow up
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with them after that.
       <br />

   1. ASHA newsletters
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; needs new target date
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; bundle it?
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: They are probably going to see some of their
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sites. They are being picky and maybe even
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unreasonable re: their H2O launches, which
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have not gone well.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: So it's a bundle in terms of the work we have
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to do, but we will ask customer to review.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe we stagger QA feedback from them? Maybe
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they'll feel better as we go?
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: HWP message is that we'll be done migrating
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all journals by the end of 2011. If that
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; approach means spilling into 2012...
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: If that approach makes the customer less
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; likely to leave...
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Xia has already done a substantial amount of
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work, so we're in good shape even now.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Perhaps we can frame these as &quot;newsletters&quot;
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rather than &quot;journals&quot;.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Didn't send out alerts in May, quarterly
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; journal, alerts had never been worked on,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when they did finally go out they were
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; labelled &quot;hwmaint&quot;. Another project has been
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with a JD for months, they're unhappy about
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: What's the action? Make a schedule and then
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; talk to directors?
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Yes, schedule first. Maybe have them looking
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at a subset of three.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: Wants someone like MarkJ to chime in.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Perhaps this is a question for the customer,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to ask them how they'd like to work with us.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: AdeV will (A) generate draft schedule, building
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in assumption that we will Beta 3 sites to ASHA
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rather than going full-on bundle; (B) forward
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; schedule to Bill and Greg Brown to give them a
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sense of what our timeline is; (C) ask them to
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help us decide whether to do standard Beta or
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to bundle, perhaps by asking ASHA to comment on
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their preferred approach.

   4. GSW
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; HWP provision of support to Ellen
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; GSW inclusion of DTD transition feedback in
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; migration spreadsheet
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; GSW confusion re: H2O style standards
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Sat in weekly meeting yesterday; a lot of
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feedback that MikeM and JDs are reviewing.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS proposed that Ellen, LindaT, XS, and MK
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (if available) meet before next week's
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meeting to go through the feedback.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: LindaT tends to feel that all of her pubs
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are nitpicky and tends to support that
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tendency; she doesn't like to push back.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the volume of content for GSW, that
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free-handed approach raises a red flag. We
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may want to talk to Bill about this.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Perhaps we should spend time with Ellen and
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; take it to Bill -before- involving LindaT.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: XS will do feedback review with Ellen, then
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; raise any concerns with Bill. Will invite PB
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the pre-Bill discussion in case there are
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; site-level feedbacks.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Maybe Paul can step in on the site side in
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a more detailed way. What's our plan for
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; site-level feedback?
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Was also in yesterday's GSW meeting; sounds
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like feedback may be more on the content,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; less on the site side. We do need to
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strategize site approach. MK agrees.
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION: PB will work with Ellen to help determine when,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what, staging sites, content sites, plan of
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attack, making sure we have things in place at
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the right times.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Is the site strategy a launch-day issue?
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: No, we need to have a coordinated approach
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throughout the project; we need to plan and
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; implement. For Duke we did not create
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; staging sites until content was loaded.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Suggested that MikeM and Ellen work together
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to come up with a more detailed plan for
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content loading (right now it's a 6-week
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; black box). This may tie in with site plan.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be loading content in waves.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Creating a staging site is like creating a
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beta site pointed to prod. Publisher won't
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; see it until it's given to them.
   <br />

   SUMMARY: &quot;Bolstering Ellen on GSW&quot; means that
   <b>
    <font>
     Xenia,
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul, Margo, Angie, Bernard need to take a

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more active role
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    than usual to define the
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; next phases of the project, to keep the
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feedback response reasonable, to keep the
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PbM and customer working together with us
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toward migration (vs &quot;polishing&quot; the sites).

    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; potentially moving from Mahesh to Ellen,
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assuming that we are able to bolster her
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; efforts on GSW
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: This one has moved to Ellen. We had a
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prekickoff last week, without JD, some
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; groundwork has been laid; the true
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kickoff will happen today; Angie and
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mahesh will drive while Ellen comes up
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to speed. No red flags yet.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Did we get an H1O analysis from Karen?
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: Yep, we did.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Will be on the call; MK needn't attend.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Rachel is estimating 2 weeks worth of work;
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; could morph into something larger. Has not

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had a chance to speak with her, yet. John

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will be on board.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: The VJ portion is an isolated piece; maybe
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we need to do the less desirable thing and
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turn site over with out VJ piece.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: Yes, is it not possible for us to get the
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; site/content ready and through alpha while
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we wait on VJ piece? Sounds like we could
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; almost do that now.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AdeV: Yes, alpha prep is substantially complete,
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but it's been substantially complete for

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; months, wit

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keen on asking the project team to pick

     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; commitment from the developers (Rachel and
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ron, specifically) re: when the VJ piece
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will be ready. Doesn't want to beta the
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; site with AAP before VJ piece is ready.
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beta currently scheduled for the week of
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oct 17. Alpha currently scheduled for the
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weeks of 3 and 10 Oct.
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XS: Agrees that it would be better to beta with
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AAP with VJ in place. Shouldn't give AAP a
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; migration date until we know when VJ piece
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will be complete.
     <br />
     <br />
     ACTION: MK will follow up with Rachel to see if she
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can commit to VJ completeness on or before

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; developers to begin planning our approach, but
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is that more of a question for the directors,

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; which book sites should migrate first,
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; potentially setting the stage for the rest?

     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; are the ersjnls actually book sites?

  1.&nbsp; Critical updates / decisions
  <br />
  <br />
  1a. ASHA Journals: any change in status?
  <br />
  <br />
  1b. ASHA Newsletters: migrate to H2O to manage maint
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; burden going forward, even though the journals may
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be leaving HWP?
  <br />
  <br />
  * update tomorrow
  <br />
  <br />
  1c. NeoReviews: migration continues to be delayed due
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to complexities surrounding Virtual Journal work.
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current &quot;draft&quot; schedule has the site going live on
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H2O on Thursday, 8 Dec.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  * needs RS for two weeks.
  <br />
  - Not sure if can wait for Oct 6 Ann V., plus training.
  <br />
  - John H booked for Linda T
  <br />
  - Sudhanshu is doing VJ service (making it available in atom store)

   1d. GSW (mid November):
   <b>
    <font>
     red flag
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    on this one due to the concurrent
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nlm transitions of ~10 child sites in combination
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the forthcoming ~2-week absence of the PjM.
    <br />
    <br />
    PB: Transition issue itself is in migration QA, as has happened with biolbull, ajnr, protocols
    <br />
    PB: MM is really concerned, re: ? set 5 of GSW.
    <br />
    BW: Ellen - going on vacation - is responsible for GSW *and* transitions.
    <br />
    <br />
    MK: Not sure chris c and Mike p know what to do. For Duke &quot;Staging&quot; was talked about, but ET did not internalize.&nbsp; In the 11th hour we had only content sites.
    <br />
    <br />
    PB: PB and XPS should always be sitting in on these GSW migration meetings.
    <br />
    <br />
    Michael Graham is pub specialist
    <br />
    <br />
    AdV TO TALK TO ET TODAY re: where the schedule
    <br />
    <font>
     <br />
     1e. ClinChem: migrate as-is (with gappy, old retro) or&nbsp; continue to hold off while the customer decides
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what they want to do with that old stuff?
     <br />
     <br />
     BW: Thought I said we should move forward as it.&nbsp; Tell Jean.
     <br />
     <br />
     1f. CTSNet: have they entered into a new agreement?
     <br />
     AdV: On hold, per PS w/o agreement.
     <br />
     BW: Euro journals have all 3 gone to OUP. One has gone to Sage. Remaining couple have not resigned, but have indicated they will.
     <br />
     AdV: Custom XSLT work here, bigger than normal
     <br />
     <br />
     <br />
     1g. ACLS: still on hold?
     <br />
     AdV: Editor died, not sure if it will continue.
     <br />
     <br />
     1h. AACR VJs: possible Drupal solution?
     <br />
     MK: 2 vj's cancer research online, and another one.
     <br />
     Now that Sp has a VJ solution, we can use that. But these will be very custom. Their TOCs are drawn from external journals.
     <br />
     BW:&nbsp; Drupal team is backlogged for 6 months
     <br />
     MK: There is content on these sites as well
     <br />
     We need to get Greg and Rachel together and figure what the implementation strategy might be
     <br />
     <br />
     <br />
     1i. MMS: any change in status?
     <br />
     BW:&nbsp; We have 60 pages of questions to answer. Then a presentation in September.
     <br />
     <br />
     <font>
      1j. Bloodbook (&quot;Edbook&quot;), and umbrella
      <br />
      MK: Darcy and Polly not involved much. Fran now. No direction from Publisher re: expectation for site. Blood migration was not cookie cutter.&nbsp; Date is &quot;firm&quot; Nov 2. No publisher guidance.
      <br />
      Fran and Mahesh are 10 days new. We need someone to shadow Mahesh, and we need someone on the project side.
      <br />
      MJ: Laura Paterson is backing Fran up on ASH.
      <br />
      <br />
      PB: Portal/umbrella is important to them.

          3a. Should we consider instituting a new dist list to
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which PjMs (and others) submit schedule changes, so
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that all relevant parties hear about such things consistently?
          <br />
          pb, mk, xps, bw, mj, rl, adv, bh,
          <br />
          MK says one of those five dates displaying in the date report.&nbsp; ....
          <br />
          &quot;Problem and at risk/missed dates;&nbsp; date changes.

          <font>
           <br />
           <br />
           3b. Why are missed milestones, potential red flags, and
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other critical items not known until they force a&nbsp; schedule slip?

   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BW: Reassess following outcome of tomorrow's ASHA

   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Not sure we should wait 4-6 weeks on this.
   <br />
   <br />

   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; won't have time herself, maybe she can hand it

       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gating factor for migration; NLM trans not done
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meant migration date not set.
       <br />

   2. Invite Rama to these meetings?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - everybody clear on bundled QA needs/plan?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - schedule slips have impact on QA
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - not all PjMs utilizing all phases of QA?
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; MK: Could be a vehicle for communicating with Rama.
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe circulate agenda to him, so he can see
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when there are QA items, or add QA items to the
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agenda.

   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; next issue won't be available in NLM XML,

   <br />
   &nbsp; -&gt; Greg will ask ASHA for delivery date of first
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; issue
   <br />
   &nbsp; -&gt; content for SIG17 (previous launch) was
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;turned around&quot; in 4 days, FWIW

   * MK: contact Tom/Sharon/etc. re: the possibility

   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; platform
   <br />

   &nbsp; -&gt; still on target to launch 26 Sep
   <br />
   <br />
   * AdeV: check in with Christine on NeoReviews
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (may not be migrated as a virtual journal;
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internal meeting may be needed to figure
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out how to do it on H2O): DONE
   <br />
   &nbsp; -&gt; Christine has queried AAP about the site's
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; current setup and the business needs behind
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it
   <br />
   &nbsp; -&gt; Christine and Margo have both suggested that
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we arrange a meeting with perhaps Todd and
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig to discuss once AAP has responded
   <br />
   <br />
   * MK: check in with Ellen on ASHS to figure out
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what's happening (releasing 3 Beta sites on
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9/06 is not feasible)
   <br />
   <br />
   * MK: set up a meeting with Paul and Rama to
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discuss QA of the bundled sites
   <br />
   <br />
   * AdeV: check in with Mahesh on bloodbook
   <br />
   <br />
   * AdeV: check in with Mahesh to confirm that he
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; knows what to do next for AJS
   <br />
   <br />
   * AdeV: check in with Bernard to discuss whether we
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can add a PjM mentor for Mahesh to ATS, or
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether we might want to staff it with a
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more senior PjM
   <br />
   <br />
   --&gt;IMPORTANT: ATS is supposed to kickoff this week.
   <br />
   <br />
   * ALL: We should discuss status of AACR VJs with
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the directors in two weeks. MK wonders if
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there might be a Drupal solution for these
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two. Question for Todd, Craig. We think it
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; needs to move out, Q1 or Q2 of 2012.
   <br />
   <br />
   * XS: check in with Jean, Bill on clinchem
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (no PjM, Retro project in play)
   <br />
   <br />

   <br />
   * AdeV: add umbrellas to Next_100
   <br />
   <br />
   -aacrjnls
   <br />
   -aapjournals - do with final site launch?
   <br />
   -alphamedpress - do with new launch?
   <br />
   -ashajnls - unclear as to direction; will launch with migration
   <br />
   -ashjnls - launch with ashsapbook?

   -----
   <br />
   <br />
   * Umbrellas not stated explicitly in migration scope
   <br />
   <br />
   -&gt; AdeV will add this info to Next_100 (see above)
   <br />
   -&gt; AdeV will add to Schedule in the form of a NOTE
   <br />
   -&gt; AdeV will remind PjMs at next meeting
   <br />
   <br />
   * Alert development work not planned adequately -
   <br />
   &nbsp; a last minute thought
   <br />
   <br />
   -&gt; MK will work with PaulB to beef up JD docs
   <br />
   -&gt; AdeV will add to Schedule in the form of a TASK
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; to review alerts, need to know when
   <br />
   <br />
   * Insufficient QA - need examples - perhaps
   <br />
   &nbsp; something just to watch out for
   <br />
   <br />
   * Inappropriate QA - tons of feedback from Musikaar
   <br />
   &nbsp; that is irrelevant, especially for developers
   <br />
   <br />
   * Not adhering to &quot;beta points to prod&quot; dates -
   <br />
   &nbsp; confusion that all prod content must be loaded -
   <br />
   &nbsp; must keep to our 2 week minimum window
   <br />
   <br />
   -&gt; MK to follow up with PaulB/JDs
   <br />
   <br />
   * Milestone dates, represented in the date report
   <br />
   &nbsp; are sometimes not accurate
   <br />
   <br />
   -&gt; AdeV reports that Bernard has recently
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; reminded the PjM group of this
   <br />
   <br />
   * Informs experience: - content assessment only
   <br />
   &nbsp; happened on sample content of 3 sites - more
   <br />
   &nbsp; complete content analysis needed
   <br />
   <br />
   -&gt; AdeV will bring this up at the next PjM meeting
   <br />
   <br />
   * OM content - insufficient sample QA leading to
   <br />
   &nbsp; reloading
   <br />
   <br />
   * Migration delays - both due to our delays as well
   <br />
   &nbsp; as customers requesting delays for reasons that
   <br />
   &nbsp; should have been known earlier

   <font>
    <br />
    Here are some ideas for today's check-in:
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    1a. Bundling migration launch sets
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- haematol, wildlifedis, telos, ajev, jaoa,
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jaapl, jabfp, annalsfm, mycologia, pdi,
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; poultsci, japr, radtech will be bundled
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for target launch dates of 18 and 19 Oct
    <br />
    TARGET: 18, 19 Oct
    <br />
    <br />
    <font>
     AdV: still need to craft communication w/customer, etc.
     <br />
     NOW: 18th and 20th October
     <br />
     MK: maybe move hortsci a week early.
     <br />
     <br />
     AdV: I'll review the doc's and edit to make them applicable
     <br />
     <font>
      <br />
      1b. Should we use modified QuickStart/MPP/MA
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; docs for bundled migrations, should we
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; develop a new base set of migration docs for
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bundled projects, or will we no longer
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; require completion of migration launch sets
      <br />
      <br />
      <font>
       MK: We'll give them access to the beta site when we cut to prod, b/c they have to edit FM pages, etc.
       <br />
       <br />
       <font>
        <br />
        <br />
        2.&nbsp; Migration launch set date changes
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <font>
         -- ascb (x2 sites)[customer motivated]: 23 Aug
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- ortho [2 wk, customer req]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25 Oct
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- bloodbook+umbrella [cust; w/umbrella]:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 Nov
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- bir (x3 sites)[up by 1 week, to get away from holiday; P&lt;P in Oct]:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7 Dec
         <br />
         <font>
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          3.&nbsp; Inventories of non-journal sites that still
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; need to be migrated, including:
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- virtual journals&nbsp; and KEs (SAGE)
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- umbrellas (10?) and portals
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- cme sites (14)
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- books sites (OUP books; aacr redbook; aap redbook; asco ed book; etc)
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- meeting abstracts ()
          <br />
          <font>
           <br />
           BW: We need to schedule these in the first half of 2012.&nbsp; Need Books Infrastructure first.
           <br />
           CME needs to get rid of XML.&nbsp; CME Mobile is hacked, needs to get it off DTL and onto Drupal.
           <br />
           <br />
           XPS: Two major project after migrations are done:
           <br />
           1) Getting rid of H10 dependencies.
           <br />
           2) OM to FM (High def) migration.&nbsp; Finish in 2012.
           <br />
           <br />
           <br />
           MK: need to have meetings about all of these; OUP books,
           <b>
            <font>
             JWatch
            </font>
           </b>
           <font>
            ,
            <br />
            <br />
            MK: for SMPTE, we should be loading conferences in H2O.
            <br />
            BW: key for meeting abstracts is we don't have appropriate metadata at the issue level (ex., titles, sponsor, days of week, location
            <br />
            BW: also, issues with huge # of articles is problem. 2400 articles kills log.

   <br />
   <br />
   -----------------
   <br />
   1. aacredbook
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - launch set #222 has too many site codes in it
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - cro/cpc should be removed, and a new launch set
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should be created
   <br />
   <br />
   Xenia: Launch set has been created.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - aacrmtg should be removed, and a new launch set
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should be created
   <br />
   <br />
   Margo: Let's discuss along with other mtg sites.
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - aacredbook should be removed, and a new launch
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set should be created
   <br />
   <br />
   Angie: Still needs a launch set.
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
   -----------------
   <br />
   2. meeting sites and H2O
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - AHA: circmtg, hypermtg, strokemtg
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - chestmtg (probably not)
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - jbjsbrproc (already scheduled)
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - ashmtg
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - aacrmtg
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - ardmtg
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - jnumedmtg
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; - ascomtg
   <br />
   <br />
   Angie: Will create launch sets for these.
   <br />
   <br />
   Margo: We need to determine H2O approach for these
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; migrations; Kathryn is planning to bring the
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <font>
    jbjsbrproc question to WARP,
    <font>
     and it will lead
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the way for other meeting sites. We might be
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; able to bundle multiple mtg sites into a
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; limited number of launch sets, but we don't
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know that, yet.
     <br />
     <br />
     Margo: ascomtg is unique in that the site is an H2O
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; site, but the content has not been migrated.
     <br />
     <br />
     <br />
     -----------------
     <br />
     3. September target date tango
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - bloodbook
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - mycologia
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - annalsfm
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - pdi
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - ortho/haematol
     <br />
     <br />
     <br />
     -----------------
     <br />
     4. Prep for 2pm call
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - discussion of proposed September-&gt;November
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - ASHA/ASHASIG migration must stay in September
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but do not have a PjM; Xia on the JD side but
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she is highly tasked; CA not yet assigned but
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not expected to be a problem; maybe Phac can
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; take this on instead of ATS; ATS may then need
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to move out accordingly; GregB should continue
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to work on new site launch
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - meeting sites have not yet been scheduled
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - virtual journals (cro/cpc) have yet to be
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scheduled; some KEs are in this position, as
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well (e.g. bonekey)
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - some umbrellas and portals still need to be
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; migrated: OUP, AACR, others?
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - cme sites still need to be migrated
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - books sites still need to be migrated
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; - explore the possibility of lumping some of the
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smaller projects together to gain efficiencies
     <br />

  AB: What does Product Management own.
  <br />
  -Demo's are lead by PD.
  <br />
  -release/deployment (Dharm; or part of quarterly site redeploy)
  <br />
  <br />
  RL was PDM at ...
  <br />
  <br />
  AB:
  <br />
  * PDM doesn't know who all the parties needed are.
  <br />
  * And we can't schedule across the organization.
  <br />
  tin cupping doesn't work for matt. Needs a technical person.
  <br />
  <br />
  MC: Matt shouldn't be project managing engineering. It's been problematic.
  <br />
  - BMJ relaunch, or jbjs, or stke, .... these big ones, distributed across the organization, and require a PjM.&nbsp; BH has done a critical job for BMJ, according to TM. That's where the PJMs should focus
  <br />
  <br />
  For NORMAL stuff, like the Roadmap stuff, even if it doesn't fit 100% into one area or another. HOWEVER, *most* of the thins are pretty easy to say &quot;this is 90% CJ and 10% RS&quot;.&nbsp; Those projects shold be managed by CJ in this case, and work with PRD and RS and making sure they're in sync.&nbsp; That way we dn't defocus PjMs from big ticket items.&nbsp; It's CJ's job to get it done, w/RS's component. If RS isn't coming thru, Cj escalates to MC and RL.
  <br />
  <br />
  AB: Development portion of project management,... PDM can monitor to-market dates, testing, etc. And farm the development portion out to a technical expert owner.
  <br />
  <br />
  MC: My program managers are going to help CJ and TM - PGMs will birddog that for others.&nbsp; TM or CJ chases Rachel. I'll hold theier feet to the fire.
  <br />
  <br />
  RL: MK manages 24 people, Greg does 8. RS will not management.&nbsp; I don't know if I'd hew to this model.&nbsp; I have 2 people for q1/q2...
  <br />
  <br />
  RL: I can't be symmetrical with what MC suggest, I don't have free PJM cycles.
  <br />
  <br />
  BH: important&nbsp; issues:
  <br />
  * grey area. between 90% proj and
  <br />
  <br />
  AB: my staff does not have the skill set to manage developers directly.
  <br />
  MC: you need to worry about requirements, and the release, and the date for release. In the middle it's SDLC stuff.
  <br />
  <br />
  RL: I also have an ask for a PGM for resource management.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  MC: HW has an endemic lack of knowledge - technical specific. The requests come in, and the projects arehanded off, and no value is added. We haven't refined, focused, clarified beforeit went forward.
  <br />
  <br />
  prod, pulisher questions. I codl allocate 1FTE as a go between PBMs and Engineering.
  <br />
  <br />
  We lack the whole &quot;technical support&quot; layer most companies have. Our &quot;support&quot; is the PBMs, i.e., there is no technical support.
  <br />
  We should turn publication specialists, and in Ron's group have a real technical support org's.
  <br />
  <br />
  AB: Piloting comes after development and before release. And it requires direct customer contact.

  H2O lessons learning meetings 9/16/2011
  <br />
  <br />
  <font>
   <br />
   Attending: BW, XPS, AdeV, BH, MK, PB
   <br />
   <br />
   Purpose: General debrief of recent migration process, and search for practical improvements
   <br />
   <br />
   (Items assigned to &quot;PxM&quot; will be actioned by AdV; &quot;CA&quot; by XPS; )
   <br />
   <br />
   ===============================================================
   <br />
   Example 1) alerts going out with hwmaint.*� domain
   <br />
   <br />
   Problem source: complacency, over allocation of resources
   <br />
   <br />
   Improvement: adherence to process
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION:
   <br />
   ��� * be sure team sticks to the published migration schedule &amp; project plan� (PxM)
   <br />
   ������� - keep referring to schedule &amp; project plan at weekly team meetings
   <br />
   ��� * create checklist to accompany JD documentation, and require signoff (PB)
   <br />
   <br />
   ==============================================================
   <br />
   Example 2a) Content reload b/c of items missed in QA
   <br />
   <br />
   ��� ACTION: increase thoroughness or scope of QA (RC)
   <br />
   <br />
   Example 2b) Content reload b/c of items reported in QA, but not actioned before prod content loading begins
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTION:
   <br />
   ��� * Early in-person meeting with JD and CL to insure every item on the feedback lists is owned (PxM)
   <br />
   ��� * Escalation of any feedback items for whom the owner is not clear (PxM)
   <br />
   ��� * Final review meeting at the moment the CA is ready to start prod loading (CA)
   <br />
   ��� * Add to the QA template a column for &quot;prereq for prod content&quot;, for completion by the CA (JN; then CA)
   <br />
   <br />
   Example 2c) Content reload b/c display work lagged content work, and content work pressed ahead
   <br />
   ��� * Have faith in machine capacity - was 1000 issues/day peak last year. So delay the load if needed, but leave time for rework
   <br />
   <br />
   ======================================================================
   <br />
   Example 3) Customer expectation run wild
   <br />
   <br />
   Problem source: early expectations set very high; HW not good at tightening the screws; market issues; abdication of responsibility by PbMs
   <br />
   <br />
   ACTIONS:
   <br />
   ��� * solutions are case-by-case.
   <br />
   ��� * Customers at risk of going out-of-control (i.e., obsessing too much on minor details during reviews) may need high-level customer management meetings (ex., GSW, ATS) No formal recommendations re: approach or ownership, everyone should stay aware at a high level.
   <br />

    <br />
    <br />
    ===========================================================
    <br />
    LIVE NOTES
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Examples:
    <br />
    ASAH alert went out with HW Maint
    <br />
    LEsson: shouldn't be put off to the end; and we were rush; and QA didn't touch the alerts,&nbsp; [missing QA item]
    <br />
    <br />
    * Are we sticking to the checklists, schedules, items;
    <font>
     complacency
     <font>
      [adherence to process]
      <br />
      <b>
       <font>
        <br />
        1. CHECKLISTS / SCHEDULES
        <br />
        <br />
        + It should be up to the PxM to make sure the checklist is getting hit. ..
       </font>
      </b>
      <font>
       <br />
       <b>
        <font>
         STICK TO THE SCHEDULE
         <br />
        </font>
       </b>
       <font>
        PB: JDs have a step-by-step migration guide. &quot;This is what you do when you go t beta, cut to prod, etc etc&quot;.
        <br />
        I think we probably should.
        <br />
        <br />
        AdV: My go to response is always &quot;look at the schedule!&quot;.&nbsp; The CA and JD all have their own domains.&nbsp; Drive it off the schedule
        <br />
        <br />
        PB: WIll develop a checklist to accompany the JD instruction lists.
        <br />
        <br />
        =========================
        <br />
        <br />
        Reloads are caused by
        <br />
        i) missing things in QA
        <br />
        ii) things reported, but were not fixed before prod loading started (process problem, or triage problem; PjM should be sure JD and CA are reviewing the other person items/&nbsp; Needs to be a final review meeting at the moment it's going to prod. )&nbsp; CA needs to review all feedback nad consult JD the point at which they go to start loading prod.
        <br />
        <br />
        PB: PxM should sit down with team IN ROOM to assign items at that point. Assign them well FROM THE START
        <br />
        <br />
        PxM should escalate items that aren't owned by team
        <br />
        <br />
        XPS: We should add to the QA template a column for &quot;prereq for prod content&quot;.&nbsp; The developer assigned to that task, or the CA.
        <br />
        <br />
        PB: Careful with timing... a JD
        <br />
        <br />
        AdV: I call JD and CA together, to review any unowned items. Whole team needs to participate.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the PjM who has to own it, even if it's assigned to someone.
        <br />
        <br />
        PB: summary
        <br />
        - after qa review, items are assigned together
        <br />
        - AdV point re: getting unloved items assigned by live meeting
        <br />
        - having content prereq column.
        <br />
        <br />
        iii) content work done, display worked lagged,&nbsp; So prod pushes ahead... and then you need to reprocess.
        <br />
        <br />
        BW: for sage/oup migrations we averaged over 1000 issues a day.
        <br />
        <br />
        CUSTOMER EXPECTATION
        <br />
        <br />
        AdV: part of problem containing publisher expectation is the PbMs are abdicating responsibility.
        <br />
        <br />
        ===
        <br />
        <br />
        * ATS, GSW require careful definition to customer management.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <font>
         * H2O content looking different from H1O, b/c of special processing we
         <br />
         did in H1O
         <br />
         <br />
         * publishers who never looked at their content previously now focus on
         <br />
         the details during migration
         <br />
         * HW's clear inclination to try to accommodate publishers when the
         <br />
         publisher gets cranky. Unwillingness to put the hammer down (perhaps
         <br />
         appropriately)
         <br />
         * publishers
         <font>
          <b>
           <font>
            not keeping on schedule
           </font>
          </b>
          <font>
           <br />
           * some very green PjMs
           <br />
           * significant things slipping through QA
           <br />
           <br />
           * unplanned staff transitions (PbM; but also PjM) that left customers sour and eroded our political capital.

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bundling?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; shall we ask ASHA their preference, or make the
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decision internally?
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: A draft schedule is now pending with Angie.

    BW: Customer doesn't want to look at ANYTHING and he wants it to be perfect
    <br />
    Styling associated w/references, authors, section names, etc,
    <br />
    should be the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; We blew it on #17, it's different. We're going to try to do better tomorrow, for #18.
    <br />
    From there it will be easy to compare h10 to h20.&nbsp; Greg has checklist. Very close now.
    <br />
    Need to reschedule. They will want it 100% accurate, rather than by a deadline. BW says must be 2011.
    <br />
    <br />
    MK: If it's completely bundled, like the other bundles, rather than Paul B.
    <br />
    <br />
    XPS: few eras. Primarily NLM XML. not much content
    <br />
    <br />
    AdV: we can't cover ClinChem or CTSnet
    <br />
    <br />
    XPS: WE NEED SUPER QA, AND WE NEED TO DO ALL 16 SITES
    <br />
    AdV: will include more detail in the proto schedule.
    <br />
    BW: Get the checklist form Greg B on 18...
    <br />
    MK: Alerts were trouble. ARE MOVING alert checks into Alpha phase.

     2. CTSNet: to migrate or not to migrate?
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; Directors appear to have decided to go ahead
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the migration in the absence of a firm
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; commitment
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; PbM (Polly) has strong reservations
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; has no official PjM at this time, but Angie is
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trying to keep moving it forward
     <br />
     <font>
      <br />
      CTSnet going to Dom b/c of OUP connection
      <br />
      BW: agree, we can't lay out a good schedule - umbrella, features. We'll need to get decisions on this pretty quickly.
      <br />
      Could be nasty umbrella arrangement if CTSnet wants sharing
      <br />
      AdV: 2 j's in Elsevier XML.... ACC...
      <br />
      Asian Annals... Sage... if CTSnet crumbles, asian annals would just get sucked into sage probably...

        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; Xenia and Paul have stepped in to provide PjM

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ellen) with additional support to ensure that
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; project remains on track
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; is backup PjM warranted in this case?
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; backup from Bill and/or MarkJ may be requested
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; depending on what is found lurking in the

        <br />
        <font>

         Adv: do we need backup PjM. Also, we might need check with BW and MJ re: feedback, and get stuck in endless polishing.

   1. ASHA newsletters: to bundle or not to bundle?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; would it trouble (or anger) them if we bundle,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the sense that they may not trust us right
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now, and may wish to check our work as we go?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; do we please them by &quot;doing all the work&quot; by
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bundling?
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; shall we ask ASHA their preference, or make the
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decision internally?
   <font>
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: A draft schedule is now pending with Angie.
    <br />
    <font>
     <br />
     BW: There was on a call with ASHA today. They don't
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; want to look at anything, ever; they want us to
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get everything 100% correct, and if we don't then
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we're doing it wrong.
     <br />
     <br />
     RL: Sounded like he expects it to look exactly the
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; same on H2O as it does on H1O.
     <br />
     <br />
     BW: It's not so much the fonts and styling, as much
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the individual bits of content that need to
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look the same, be positioned in the same way as
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as on H1O. The things that ASHA is most
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; concerned about are: author display, title
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; display, section names. Structure.
     <br />
     <br />
     XS: Is a content briefing required here?
     <br />
     <br />
     BW: ASHA gave us a list of things that we need to
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; correct in #18 (launch) before we go live
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tomorrow. If we can solve everything in #18 to
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASHA's satisfaction, we should be able to go
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forward with migration. If HWP sees anything not
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on ASHA's list, we need to call them out for ASHA.
     <br />
     <br />
     XS: Are 1-16 cookie-cutter?
     <br />
     <br />
     BW: Yes. #17 (live) and #18 (pending) are now higher
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; visibility, and ASHA doesn't like what they're
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seeing, so we're going back in to address
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problems on both sites.
     <br />
     <br />
     MK: We are talking about a bundled approach.
     <br />
     <br />
     MJ: This does make it easier for ASHA to pin a
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;failure&quot; on HWP.
     <br />
     <br />
     XS: Few eras, not much content.
     <br />
     <br />
     BW: Yes, bundled approach. ASHA wants it to be done
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100% accurately.
     <br />
     <br />
     MK: Can the when be in January?
     <br />
     <br />
     BW: No, it has to be in 2011.
     <br />
     <br />
     MK: Who will PjM this one? Perhaps Paul, will take it
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; offline.
     <br />
     <br />
     ACTION: MK will talk to Paul and others about PjM.
     <br />
     <br />
     XS: We need to be clear that internal QA needs to be
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SERIOUSLY EXTRA SUPER-DUPER (emphasis Xenia's).
     <br />
     <br />
     ALL: AGREED!
     <font>
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: AdeV will incorporate explicit QA piece in
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; draft bundled schedule, as well as a task to
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QA alerts.
      <br />
      <br />
      ACTION: AdeV will solicit ASHA list of feedback from
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greg.
      <font>
       <br />
       <br />
       MK: We are now going to force an alerts sign-off on
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; launches, as well.
       <br />
       <font>
        <br />
        ACTION: PB will follow up with Rama to make sure that
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QA is happening on alerts.
        <font>
         <br />
         <br />
         MK: Will PbM be the person to officially sign off on
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sites before we show them to ASHA?
         <br />
         <br />
         MJ: Yes. It will be a new PbM, not Greg.
         <br />

         2. CTSNet: to migrate or not to migrate?
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; Directors appear to have decided to go ahead
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the migration in the absence of a firm
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; commitment
         <b>
          <font>
           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; PbM (Polly) has strong reservations
          </font>
         </b>
         <font>
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; has no official PjM at this time, but Angie is
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trying to keep moving it forward
          <br />
          <br />
          BW: CTSNet is split in three, now: two are proceeding,
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just no decision about the umbrella and which
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't. The one that's gone to SAGE is in progress.
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three that have gone to OUP are in progress.
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining journals are not in progress. What
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we do with the umbrella or not has not been
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decided.
          <br />
          <br />
          BH: Polly indicates that after annual meeting (in
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; late Sep 2011), we may have more clarity.
          <br />
          <br />
          MJ: Louise covering for Polly, but CTSNet will go to
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dom.
          <br />
          <br />
          BW: CTSNet does need to give us their decisions on
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the umbrella, the associations between the sites,
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the feature set, etc.
          <br />
          <br />
          AdeV: Reminder that two of the CTSNet sites come to
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; us in the Elsevier DTD, will require a custom
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XSL transform, work has begun but is not yet
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; complete. Also, the SAGE journal is currently
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; part of the larger CTSNet launch set, and does
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not have a migration date, yet.
          <br />
          <br />
          BW: How to move forward with that title is a question
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for Bert/SAGE.
          <br />
          <br />
          MJ: Thinks that we should allow CTSNet to have their
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; annual meeting, and that Dom should follow up
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with them after that.
          <br />
          <br />
          ACTION: MJ will follow up with Dom on next steps.

  <br />
  1. WHO GETS TO CREATE TASKS? if PjMs/PbMs do that, the developers need to be in on crafting the tasks.

  <b>
   <font>
    TASKS MUST BE ACCURATELY CREATED, esp if you intend to do progress reporting off them

    &quot;What are the tasks? Whose tasks are they?....&quot;

  PLT: Transition was done incorrectly

   I am suggesting a new concept in order to track some bugs that I believe
   <br />
   cannot be unique to this publisher. Such bugs will be called Referenced
   <br />
   Bugs or RB for short. This concept has probably been initiated before
   <br />
   under a different name, but for now I will use the proposed name for
   <br />
   this project. Here' s the list I currently have:
   <br />
   <br />
   RB Greek:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greek letters in formulas were encoded as
   <br />
   images in H1O, then converted into unicode for H2O, but there is a need to
   <br />
   italicize them in some situations (such as formulas). This cannot be done
   <br />
   today.
   <br />
   <font>
    <br />
    RB Citation-Authors:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Author names must follow a certain format.
    <br />
    The one required by BiolBull cannot be done today.
    <br />
    <br />
    RB Citation-Editors:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Editors names must follow a certain
    <br />
    format. The one required by BiolBull cannot be done today.
    <font>
     <br />
     <br />
     RB Equation:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Math equations were encoded as images in
     <br />
     H1O, then converted somehow by the Parser. The result is garbage in
     <br />
     BiolBull.
     <br />
     <br />
     RB Tagging:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;title&gt;&nbsp; tags are converted into&lt;source&gt;
     <br />
     by the NLM conversion process. However, we lose some context such as:
     <br />
     Chapter Title, Book Title, PhD Dissertation Title, etc...
     <br />
     <br />
     RB Italics:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a sentence is italicized, any string
     <br />
     within the sentence, that would normally be italicized by default (such
     <br />
     as a genus name), should be displayed in plain style instead. We cannot do
     <br />
     that for now.

    QA depends on PjMs
   </font>
  </b>
  <font>
   to inform the readiness of sites for respective QA tasks. This requires PjMs coordinating with JDs to prepare site, CAs load applicable content and both JDs/CA do very basic testing to ensure the site is ready for start of QA. PjMs can ensure this and inform QA to start QA. I find this is not happening or not happening timely to adhere to schedules. [KEEP SCHEDULES UPDATED]
   <br />
   <br />
   After hearing on site readiness from PjMs, QA will do the testing and inform back the PjM (and the team) about finishing of their testing along with entries in Internal QA for all issues as New. Those issues need to be reviewed by JD and CA with the help of PjM and addressed as

    - &quot;hot and heavy&quot;; MK and XPS intervened last week. We're getting deep in beta feedback, they're picky. We need ot cut to prod today, but content hasn't been loaded to prod. Waiting for signoff on one bug issue.&nbsp; Might slip by a week, 8/10 to 8/17. Customer wants correct rather than timely.&nbsp; MK has sort of taken it on. Mahesh.

     #1. When schedule is defined, WE STICK TO IT. They can live w/ambiguity for a while.

      The Process:
      <br />
      <font>
       - We have identified, with PbM approval, 14 sites that are very basic and can be treated in a streamlined manner
 - These 14 sites are organized into 2 sets of bundled migrations, with essentially the same time frame - 7 will launch on 10/18, 7 will launch on 10/20
 - We do not need kickoff meetings for these migrations, but have already held an internal kickoff mtg for developers and content leads
 - We are initially creating beta sites (no alpha sites), and these beta sites will point to prod. We will load sample content directly into prod
 - We will internally Q/A the sample content loaded into prod and will NOT turn over the beta sites to the publisher early in the process
       <font>
        <font>
         - We will NOT require publisher feedback on the sample content or site setup
 - When the sample content is &quot;signed off&quot; by us, we will begin loading the remainder of the content into prod, starting after Labor Day
 - We will internally Q/A the site and content AGAIN, later in the process, when all of site work is done
 - After a second round of Q/A, we will plan to turn the beta sites over to the publisher, so that they can review the site, and work on their file manager pages. This turnover is scheduled for approximately 10/4 - about 2 weeks before migration day.
 - We will expect Publishers to look over their site in just a few days (2-3) and let us know if they have any outstanding questions. They will NOT be expected to Q/A their site, or provide feedback in a spreadsheet. As always, they can work on their FM pages until the day before migration.

   Based on your feedback, we have taken the next step towards migrating
   <br />
   several journals to H2O in a &quot;bundled&quot; fashion. Next_100 has been updated,
   <br />
   and the tentative target dates are as follows:
   <br />
   <br />
   Tuesday, 18 October&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thursday, 20 October

   I'm working with Bill and others on an alternate set of migration docs
   <br />
   (QuickStart, MPP, MA). My goal is to be able to provide you with a final
   <br />
   version of each that you can prepare for your customers before we really
   <br />
   start digging into the work.
   <br />
   <br />
   Please let me know if there are any initial questions.

       * Launch projects may require different generated dates than

       &nbsp; those developed for Migrations. Does this mean that we need
       <br />
       &nbsp; two different QuickBase schedule templates? Right now we're
       <br />
       &nbsp; using one template for both types of projects.

       <br />
       * In the absence of 100% PjM coverage of launch and migration
       <br />
       &nbsp; projects, Margo has asked whether we should consider a
       <br />
       &nbsp; limited coverage model would allow us to stretch our limited
       <br />
       &nbsp; pool of PjM resources? Here are some ideas that Margo, Xenia
       <br />
       &nbsp; and I tossed around when the three of us met yesterday:
       <br />
       <br />
       &nbsp; --&gt; PjMs begin projects: Margo and Xenia would need to
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure that their resources were meeting project
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deadlines so that the PbMs don't have to; PbMs would
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manage customer interactions; feedback would be a
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; big time sink for non-PjM resources.
       <br />
       <br />
       --OR--
       <br />
       <br />
       &nbsp; --&gt; PjMs join projects at Alpha review: more work would
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be required of PbMs up-front; Margo and Xenia would
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; still have schedule approval; PjM would handle
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feedback drudgery and customer interactions (as
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appropriate for the PbM and the customer).
       <br />
       <br />
       --AND/OR--
       <br />
       <br />
       &nbsp; --&gt; We try to leverage QAE to help manage feedback: maybe
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they troll for feedback items that have been marked
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;fixed,&quot; do a visual confirmation, and close? Not
       <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sure they have any time for this sort of thing.
       <br />
       <br />
       Questions:
       <br />
       - how many new QA resources (interns, other) are joining
       <br />
       &nbsp; us for the summer, and are they fully committed
       <br />
       - any updates on hiring of even more PjMs

    <br />
    <br />
    * standard migrations are benchmarked at 15% of a PjM's time.

    AdV: Until recently, it was expected of the PbM. But AdV has always done. I started doing it on AMA, and kept doing it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can help with it, too.

  AdV response
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  14:15 amdevilliers: 1. COB Biology Open: I'm not sure I understand Margo's comments. We don't have a PjM for this one, do we? Is she saying that the launch should be less difficult because we've got their other sites on H2O already, perhaps?
  <br />
  14:16 bing13: Yeah,
  <br />
  14:16 bing13: she's saying &quot;at least we've done some H2o sites with COB already.&quot; That's all.
  <br />
  14:17 amdevilliers: 2. RSMP: I can see the wisdom in upping it to 40%. I'm not remembering what the new feature is that's being developed, though, which is troubling since this is my project. I'll take a look.
  <br />
  14:17 bing13: sorry, she didn't say
  <br />
  14:17 amdevilliers: 3. ASHAJNLS/ASHASIG: I'm happy to go with her lower estimate. I think we also speculated that some efficiencies could be gained if the same PjM tackled them together.
  <br />
  14:18 bing13: yes.
  <br />
  14:19 amdevilliers: 4. ASHS. Upping this to 20% makes good sense. (Rich's RCPsych is a 3 site + 1 umbrella project, and it's already at 20%.)
  <br />
  14:20 bing13: ok
  <br />
  14:21 amdevilliers: 5. GSW: Yes, moving from 45% to 50% sounds reasonable to me. Always better to cushion rather than hope for smooth sailing. When we spoke last about GSW, Margo indicated that she thought the launch should be handled in parallel by the migration team; has she changed her mind about that? Has she spoken with LindaT, do you know?
  <br />
  BH: no
  <br />
  <br />
  14:24 amdevilliers: 6. BIR: I'm happy to reset this one at 20% (3 sites + 1 umbrella) if Margo agrees; I don't recall why I thought this would be more challenging than a typical multi-site migration.
  <br />
  <br />
  14:25 amdevilliers: Oh, sorry: 7. CHEST meeting abstracts. Jean specifically requested a PjM, but if we don't got one, hearing that this shouldn't be too difficult to manage makes it less painful to try to push this one back.
  <br />
  14:25 bing13: yes. and Margo actually volunteered to speak with her.
  <br />
  14:25 bing13: Did I mention that I love Margo?

  ASHAJNLS/ASHASIG together are less than 40%; maybe 35% (20% for the major titless, 15% for newsletters.)

      OTOH, any new person has to learn everything from scratch.&nbsp; Could bootstrap someone with appropriate support.&nbsp; Would be faster for me, w/content and H10.

      There's plenty of people to ask questions of.

      I don't care. If I work on migs then books, I'll document everything.

   <br />
   RK: can we push Oct mig's out through Nov
   <br />
   <br />
   XPS: We should not agree to publisher requests to slip the migration date out.

   LB: Launches are easier, should differentially kept with PbM's. Need to build relationship with customer etc.

   ==========================================
   <br />
   1. stoplight and related
   <br />
   a. the short-term request
   <br />
   b. the larger need to coordinate; assess resource availability; do scheduling
   <br />
   c. the EVEN larger need for PROCESS,
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - makes more efficient use of people's time
   <br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mark c: &quot;we've got to stop w/the emails on this kind of stuff and have the PbMs? make an entry in QB, complete w/the explanation of what and when... Can we have the PbM do that for this? &quot;
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; liz tb: &quot; very much appreciate project management support for the Full Migration project we need to complete for JCO this year.
   <font>
    Xenia has the details of the project
    <font>
     , but in summary - we need to convert all of JCO's back content to NLM XML and the load these files to the site.
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - allows intelligent analysis to be done, rather than &quot;swarming&quot;
     <br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not saying &quot;I don't want to deal with it!&quot; and running away - on either side.

           A proposed agenda for today's H2O migration (and launch) check-in follows
           <br />
           my signature. Critical items for today's discussion are, in my estimation:
           <br />
           <br />
           * biolbull won't renew contract/LOA until we've confirmed migration
           <br />
           &nbsp; date; LindaT needs this info by the end of the week; currently
           <br />
           &nbsp; scheduled for 31 August, but no PjM has been assigned; not clear
           <br />
           &nbsp; whether Linda is available to participate as PbM
           <br />
           <br />
           * new GSW launch not yet in Next_100; anybody have info on that so
           <br />
           &nbsp; that we can add it to the list for resource planning?
           <br />
           <br />
           * &quot;too many&quot; launches and migrations scheduled for September; M/A/X
           <br />
           &nbsp; needs help prioritizing so that some can be shifted out
           <br />
           <br />
           * review of projects with &quot;questionable&quot; status (item #8)
           <br />
           <br />
           * discussion of the PbM role in a launch/migration project when a PjM
           <br />
           &nbsp; resource has been assigned
           <br />
           <br />
           Additions and revisions are welcome.
           <br />
           <br />
           Speak to you all whenever we eventually meet!

           <br />
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more of their migrations (i.e. Greg, Christine,

           <br />

  + Put PLC (product life cycle) process in place
  <br />
  + products, customer requests in pipeline
  <br />
  + multiple bug trackers - crazy!&nbsp; We're using Jira! Done! It will be part of our general tool set. Greenhopper.&nbsp;&nbsp; Will tie into QB - formal interface. Could get us a consultant in, to help us design our Jira workflow.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's that integral.
  <br />
  <br />
  RL: My engineers want to look at *all* of their tasks through Jira.
  <br />
  MC: great! Jira's great for that.
  <br />
  <br />
  * more transparency, including schedules!
  <br />
  * I'm BIG on hitting schedule targets. We'll blow some - &quot;This is really new for these guys&quot;
  <br />
  <br />
  MC: you assign tasks to developers...&nbsp; I don't want priorities changed day-to-day.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  MC: I will rely on Mark J to prioritize all customer requests
  <br />
  <br />
  MC: Tom made the point this morning, that everything as &quot;urgent&quot;, is nothing is not prioritizing.
  <br />
  <br />
  MC: I asked Polly to tweak QB ... If MC and RL aren't goign to use it as their main tools, maybe we don't want to ask her to do huge amount of work.
  <br />
  Asked for a few
  <b>
   <font>
    Project life Cycle fields: Investigation, Design, Coding, Testing, Released to Production target dates.
   </font>
  </b>
  <font>
   &nbsp; Mitigations, respect for target dates... Agile burndown and remaining work charts should be had on a daily basis.
   <br />
   <br />
   MC: Am cautious about engineers inflating their estimates.&nbsp; I'm going to grade my engineers on hitting schedule, and quality targets.&nbsp;&nbsp; I ike engineers to come up with dates
   <b>
    <font>
     themselves, so they own it
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    .
    <br />
    <br />
    MC: sometime requirements change.&nbsp; We've gotta have a process to handle change requests. That's a date change, not a slip.
    <br />
    <br />
    MC: I want us to get to more and more and more Agile development methodology.
    <br />
    <br />
    MC: I require cross-team design reviews.&nbsp; I want to see the minutes from the code review before I sign off.
    <br />
    <br />
    MC: We seem to be heading towards QB as an external-facing tool.&nbsp; Jira faces inward.
    <br />
    <br />
    MC:&nbsp; I would like to move towards Releases. But that's beyond me.&nbsp; I told time I suggest a quarterly system code releaes, and monthly app's release.
    <br />
    This ties to the roadmap. TOm wants 18-24 month roadmap
    <br />
    <br />
    MC: our production environment is unstable. If we fix the operations problems, we'll still have engineering-habit generated problems.
    <br />
    <br />
    POR (product * roadmap)
    <br />
    ==================
    <br />
    RAMA
    <br />
    <br />
    * 3 summer interns
    <br />
    Rachel, Greg, Rachel, TOdd, Mark - talked on what they can work on
    <br />
    - automation
    <br />
    (1)... XSL widget (core logic)
    <br />
    (2) middleware/backend SASS,&nbsp; all APP. We can use that to validate APIs.&nbsp; [HWX, ]
    <br />
    (3) HWX - test journal. variety of sample content, cover idiosyracies of our content.&nbsp; Daily basis. Run through that sample content thru HWX.
    <br />
    Not 100% sure if 3rd intern should go on this. HWX team believes they have solid testing. they don't have time to work with us.

  Some work in last year to make it a bit more customized. Polly *still* hasnt completed NExt 100. We still don't know&nbsp; which H1O features need porting.

     + TAKE IT TO WARP if there is any possibility of escalation, productizing, comfusion, etc

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Steps/Process after WARP process&nbsp; --Xenia
  <br />
  Out of warp, we get WHO and HOW, and the steps
  <br />
  XPS: that's at a high level. Where does the tech spec come from?&nbsp; Warp meeting names names, but it doesn't mean those people are going to be available.
  <br />
  LB: project charter.... signoff, etc etc.
  <br />
  RL: priority, resources, in constricted environment. (Old HW: schedule, prioritize, fail)
  <br />
  RL: (Kanban queue)
  <br />
  Should also apply for complex projects as well
  <br />
  &quot;I'm not afraid to take baby steps.&quot;
  <br />
  RL:
  <font>
   You need prioritization before you do the technical spec
   <font>
    <br />
    <font>
     RL:
     <font>
      So it needs to go back to PbM, who prioritizes within the list of the customer's priorities
      <font>
       <br />
       RL: WARP identifies *who* could write the tech spec.
       <br />
       XPS: How do we identify the resources?
       <br />
       BH: Boil the ocean!

    <br />
    <br />
    schwab had 1,000 developers.
    <br />
    Remember schwab problem were $100k projects tripped an executive review, so there were tons of projects just below&nbsp; $100k.
    <br />
    <br />
    XPS: site-support does casual review well. But can't handle PRD-sized stuff.
    <br />
    Site-support doesn't have representatives from all invovled gorups
    <br />
    Site-support is triage group for one silo.
    <br />
    Another is AC; content; data warehouse,
    <br />
    <br />
    Customer request meeting: WARP - weekly analysis review and projects would meet weekly, and go through the requests.
    <br />
    Schwab did this for 1000 programmers, with a meeting of 25 Tech department heads. The result was feasibility; ballpark difficult;
    <br />
    A written functional spec was required for a PjM to hand a project to this &quot;tech star&quot; review
    <br />
    <br />
    Whoever wrote the PRD should be in the room.
    <br />
    <br />
    WARP input is PRD [customer requests; product feature enhancement; platform innovation]
    <br />
    <br />
    WARP output is feasibility, approach, ID steps, ID people/groups, and if requested ballpark of effort and timing
    <br />
    <br />
    BH: whatever you bring to WARP should have an ID.
    <br />
    RL:&nbsp; the meeting should have a recorder; the record should also get the results of the discussion at WARP.
    <br />
    <br />
    RL: Mike said we need to use QB. Jira will be used for bug tracking system.
    <br />
    We have bought site license for Jira.
    <br />
    <br />
    RL: This means site developers ahve two systems that they have to consult.
    <br />
    <br />
    XPS: at Atypon there was a QB and a Jira,, and all records were reflected in both systems.&nbsp; Developers only looked at BZugzilla (Jira)

     Below are my notes from the meeting - let me know if there are any important omissions.
     <br />
     <br />
     (1) Rama's current QA process during a migration involves the following points:
     <br />
     (a) QA of alpha site (focus on sample issues &amp; site).
     <br />
     (b) QA when alpha is renamed to beta.
     <br />
     (c) QA when beta points to prod (focus on OM or FM content &amp; site)
     <br />
     (d) QA when new site launches/migrates.
     <br />
     <br />
     (2) Team suggests that point (b) above is not a high-risk change necessitating QA. Content and
     <br />
     code is not copied or modified. Margo will get back to the team with specific detail on what happens
     <br />
     during this step (is the beta site copied or regenerated?). Regardless, it's been suggested that the
     <br />
     QA team skips this step. The PbM should be responsible to QA the publisher's account access on
     <br />
     the beta site -- this is the only thing that has proved to be error prone in the past.
     <br />
     Dave will set up a machine that the PbMs will use to validate that sites work with pub access.
     <br />
     <br />
     (3) Musikaar doesn't have access to the beta site or to the content site. They do their automated QA
     <br />
     on the beta site only (when it is pointed to prod).
     <font>
      Rama to work with MarkH to advise on where the content
      <br />
      sites need to live so that Musikaar can have access.
      <font>
       <br />
       <br />
       (4) For OM, we'll have the following QA steps:
       <br />
       (a) Sample issues from recent era are QAed in alpha.
       <br />
       (b) When beta points to prod (~2 weeks before launch) QA team tests all content, including OM.
       <br />
       No content QA happens on the content site.
       <br />
       (c) QA when new site launches/migrates.
       <br />
       <br />
       (5) For FM, we'll have the following QA steps:
       <br />
       (a) Sample issues from recent era are QAed in alpha.
       <br />
       (b) Sample issues from older eras are QAed on content site (timing of this will vary, but generally it will
       <br />
       happen around the same time when the publisher is doing their beta QA)
       <br />
       (c) When beta points to prod (~2 weeks before launch) QA team tests all content.
       <br />
       (d) QA when new site launches/migrates.
       <br />
       <br />
       (6) Musikaar runs their
       <font>
        automated scripts
        <font>
         on samples and full content as well. Musikaar also invests time
         <br />
         after each QA cycle to clean up the scripts based on what was found and marked as 'will not fix'.
         <br />
         <br />
         (7) Currently, the QA team is not performing any validation QA on fixes, but hopefully this will be introduced�when we start using Jira. The current plan is to use Jira for externally reported bugs.
         <br />
         <br />
         (8) browser testing - Dave will provide the QA team with 2 desktop machines to do side by side QA on 2�different browsers.
         <br />
         <br />
         (9) Next week is DDT but Ron will reschedule the meeting earlier in the week (Mon afternoon?) &amp; we'll review�Rama's visual design demonstrating the OM and FM QA process. At that time, we can determine if Rama can�present this at the PbM meeting on Tues. The goal of that presentation is to inform the PbMs of the QA processes�and also give them information that they can tell customers.

    Agile is better for new projects, where things aren't well defined up front. If everything is totally defined ahead of time, waterfall might be the way to go.

  RL: you can use scrum task boards (&quot;information radiator&quot; when it's tactile)
  <br />
  Sprints focus on new functionality, but other methods that are part of Scrum - like task boards are universally applicable.
  <br />
  <br />
  scrum (a management methodology) is often paired with XP (programming techniques)
  <br />

    Improving our requirements process:
    <br />
    1) Continuing to work with PbMs to transition from long email threads and summarize
    <br />
    2) Make QB notifications work better
    <br />
    3) Form customization
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heavy user vs light user
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xenia wants to
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; task assigned to someone, they need some help for some or all of it: secondary or tertiary
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cc field, essentially, for notifications
    <br />
    <br />
    Margo: JDs are bought in: how can we make a form that is more amenable/usable for JDs?
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the standpoint that we would then have a model we could take to AC to have them drive the form they need
    <br />
    <br />
    Time tracking: Ron:
    <br />
    1) what is stacked up for a developer to do
    <br />
    2) how much time does each developer spend
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how much are they working?
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how much time does it actually take to do stuff?
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how much time it took vs how much time was estimated to take?
    <br />
    <br />
    Time Tracking: What
    <br />
    <br />
    Xenia needs:
    <br />
    1) the queue
    <br />
    2) work estimates

     <br />
     XPS: likes qb. what non-users don't like
     <br />
     AL and SL both fault QB for the&nbsp; # of e-mails it generates
     <br />
     <br />
     RL: wants everyone to get on board a cleaned-up QB.
     <br />
     <br />
     RL: QB form customization... ease of use vs ease of learning;

    Gracenote Thursday, Aug 26th, 2pm
    <br />
    2000 Powell Street, 15th floor
    <br />
    Emeryville 94608
    <br />
    sw 510-547-9680
    <br />
    <br />
    Visiting: Shawn McKay, Saood Shah
    <br />
    <br />
    The Gracenote parking structure is open during the week to visitors.&nbsp; When you arrive, please come up to the receptionist on the 15th floor, and she�ll let us know you�ve arrived.&nbsp; Ultimately, we�ll end up on the 13th floor in one of our brand new conference rooms (�Twin Peaks�), but you will all need to check in at reception on 15 as guests before we can bring you down.
    <br />
    <br />
    Between myself and Saood, we likely have almost 3 hours of material / process / tools / tips / etc to share.&nbsp; If you have anything in particular that you want to see covered, please let us know.&nbsp; For now, we expect to cover items such as:
    <br />
    <br />
    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PACE (Product and Cycle-Time Excellence) / PMO 101 at Gracenote
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how do we manage projects
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how do we govern projects
    <br />

    <br />
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enterprise resource management&nbsp; how do we handle this in a mixed process environment (Waterfall and Agile Scrum) with 2 different, but married, tools
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS Project Server

      </font>
     </font>
    </i>
    <font>
     <br />
     <br />
     I was hired into a 15-year-old organization of 150 that's still mostly operating as though it's an organization of 5 or 10; we're changing out our architecture, much as Gracenote has done twice. But unlike how I've heard Mickey describe it, we're trying to deliver features to our 150 publishers (and 1300+ scholarly journals) simultaneous with changing the platform. Not surprisingly, the platform change is taking four years, not two; the organization is dramatically congested; projects get attention only if they're in absolute flames; and the organization is wildly inefficient at dealing with all that.
     <br />
     <br />
     Improving our processes even just slightly would be ever-so-welcome. To give you an idea, HighWire has not even had a shared calendar system (we're about halfway through viral adoption now, I'm happy to say), we have perhaps a half dozen bug tracking systems, and nothing in the way of project management tools.
     <font>
      We do have three solid project managers (despite only one having had any real training in project management) along with a development manager who is exceptional partly because of a personal interest in doing project management well. We also have some of the nicest people I've ever worked with.

  Eliciting Requirements: Questions for PbMs:
  <br />
  What are you trying to accomplish? What is the problem you're trying to solve?
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <font>
   neither the publisher nor the PbM should be specifying a techn solution
   <font>
    <br />
    Do you understand what it is they're trying to accomplish? what cust expects to see?
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exactly what and where will they see on the site?
    <br />
    Sample URL
    <br />
    How does this apply to back content?
    <br />
    Peripheral systems that should be thought about:
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does this affect alerts?
    <br />
    What would the customer be willing to pay for for this?
    <br />
    Does it have to be a quick thing for them to want to do this?
    <br />
    Did you specify the journalcode(s)?&nbsp; Is this h10 or h20?
    <br />
    Have you translated publisher terminology into the correct Highwire terminology?
    <br />
    <font>
     ...
     <br />
     Did you re-read your request before sending?

  <br />
  <br />
  G had been trying to adopt Salesforce.com for a year and a half.

  Salesforce (SF) originally did simply:&nbsp; accounts &lt;-&gt; opportunities &lt;-&gt; contacts
  <br />
  provides security, scalability, forecasting (on opportunities, which have probabilities)

  SF also has &quot;custom tables&quot;, which let us build in our project management&nbsp; stuff.

     [we want to add up to at least 40&nbsp;&nbsp; hours, so that's a pretty complete accounting]
     <br />
     S: We tell our PSA engineers, they're better and more important than &quot;grunty&quot; engineers, and we expect more than from them, ex., accounting for the customer's sake, etc..
     <br />
     S: If we dont have visible, metrics, payoff calculations, we're not going anywhere.

          We use MS Project Server to manager resoruces. So if someone is working on 3 projects, it will be

           The resource map TOOL provides visibility and we can work on that

           Agile people don't want to plan beyond 4 weeks, which doesn't work well with this!

             When Shawn got to Gracenote 5 or so years ago, it was very HW like with prioritization&nbsp; and resource management. Executives wouldn't give meaning prioritization, everything was #1. Sounds very familiar.

               &quot;IT's a process of educating the executives&quot;
               <br />
               It was very hard to get people to report their time. It was a persuasion effort.
               <br />
               We actually have them report their hours through the PWA (project web access) web inteface (to the resource map)
               <br />
               <br />
               Some of their managers use MS Project 10%/50%/100% done feature. Shawn much prefers that people enter their actual hours each week, b/c it helps us learn and improve estimates.
               <br />
               <br />
               We keep telling them &quot;We don't use the resource reporting for anything excpet proj management!&quot;
               <br />
               <br />
               SM has some great consultants for bringing in this kind of system.
               <br />
               SM does prefer MS Project Server.&nbsp; For pure resource management,

  13:53 &lt;Todd&gt; just FYI, Phac is going around my back trying to get Matthias to change the design for a service Matthias is writing. The design in question was developed and reviewed by Matthias, Ann Van, John Haggerty, myself and Craig.&nbsp; I've told Phac to knock it off but if he pulls this stunt again I'm going to pitch a hissy-fit
  <br />
  13:56 &lt;bing13&gt; why would he want to change the design?
  <br />
  13:56 &lt;Todd&gt; you might have to ask him that, presumably because he thinks he knows better
  <br />
  13:57 &lt;bing13&gt; o-kay
  <br />
  13:57 &lt;Todd&gt; the thing is his suggested changes will make the service run slower and take longer to develop
  <br />
  13:57 &lt;Todd&gt; he wouldn't know that but that's why developers do design and project managers do requirements

  13:12 &lt;bh&gt; Dharm, I don't think I'd share the &quot;Lucene solution&quot; with the internal team ahead of time. First off, some might think it puts the cart before the horse. Secondarily, Project Managers don't do design here - at least not formally.

   Storytelling
   <br />
   - was &quot;Medical Explorer Scout&quot;. Was going to go to Med Scho. Coll San Mateo, then to UC Berkeley.&nbsp; But decided medicine was not for him. Got into music, playing and writing, two times spoke to serious record labels.
   <br />
   Wrote a system for family business
   <br />
   Worked at apple for a few years. Took classese there.
   <br />
   Managing environmental test labs (heat rooms, test chambers). Put services under network control.
   <br />
   Biannual APple layoffs. No where to go in that divsion, asked for it.
   <br />
   When to Storage Dimensions working for tech support group. Built very early web site, for querying on device.
   <br />
   Friend called me to Sega, knew Macs well. Bad career choice, horrible hours, bad pay.&nbsp; THen that division closed down.
   <br />
   Learning company - production engineer, built OED on CD; closed that division.
   <br />
   Yahoo - senior eng. Music, Travel, etc. ;
   <br />
   then moved to internal group, for internal intranet. Built tools - development, finance, etc.&nbsp; I was a project lead at that point,&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I pushed towards Proj Mgmt.. My studies there weren't particular well focused for software devo.
   <br />
   Brought the internal group to external group standards (ex., PHP, repository, etc)
   <br />
   Then focused more on
   <br />
   Then butted heads with VP of the group. ... analytic tools for modifying search results in real time.... So I moved to the Search group. After a few months there, a big round of Yahoo! layoffs.
   <br />
   Then I decided to go PjM.
   <br />
   LiveOps, call center platform.&nbsp; managing with ... software dev.... core platform upgrades.... Op center...
   <br />
   Very challenging environment, telecomm is more rigid than web to engineer.&nbsp; And lots of culture change to hew to audit.&nbsp; Focus more and more on enterprise customers.
   <b>
    <font>
     I'm comfortable with working with external customers

   </b>
   <font>
    .
    <br />
    Abrupt scaling back on Enterprise. Including SVP, etc.
    <br />
    <br />
    Then to Mavericks. STEM...&nbsp; airframe, propulsion, telemetry. Two 25' rockets, with nasa and google payloads. I did PjM, airframe, building their web site.&nbsp; Built social networking engine, to let groups form for research projects.
    <br />
    <br />
    Need to get busy again. Been looking, only talked

                x I think that kind of environment is becoming more commonplace.&nbsp; @ Yahoo!, working with lots of different groups (inputs and outputs), with different styles, and which I had no influence over. Groups that worked differently.
                <br />
                Even more at LiveOps. That was chaotic. Unsettled, that became the norm.

  Life at KP
  <br />
  - revamping intranet. was higgly piggly. Launches later this year.
  <br />
  180k employees. Federated, regions autonomous
  <br />
  Biz proj management, to help internal clients who are converting over to the new system.&nbsp; PR, corporate comm, brand strategy customers. I define platform to be useful for them. I have *some* CMS background.
  <br />
  I have biz analyst, and technical project person assigned, now I have a biz side Project manager too. Acceptance testing, etc. Comm strategy and plan is big part.&nbsp; So KP &quot;migration&quot;.
  <br />
  <br />
  KP PjM is immature in my area. We have a lot of PMI certified PjMs, but not with experience. Management doesn't appreciate the need for risk lists and schedules etc. Fairly loose. I end up mentoring our PjMs.&nbsp; Hard skill and Soft skill.
  <br />
  We are redefining intake process in Visio.

        <font>
         <br />
         <font>
          * Have you used Agile SDLC management?

           <br />

                      <font>
                       GC: prefer simpler tools. Spreadsheets are fine for risk and issue lists. Time tracking tools etc - the compliance issue is big. MS Project is OK, but I don't love it.

                             <br />
                             It's a high-touch situation, on phone and in person, talking through tings with him, and showing roadmap (search first, then collaboration, then... etc) of when things will happen.&nbsp; Expectation setting; building trust;

   How much formal artifacts? What's the approval process?
   <br />

    PjM QUESTIONS
    <br />
    <br />
    <font>
     * What kinds of web-centric projects have you managed?
     <font>
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <font>
       * extremely fast-paced,&nbsp; somewhat chaotic: give me concrete examples
       <font>
        <br />
        - not the aggressiveness of schedules that causes anxiety, it's the amount of chaos.&nbsp; It's competing demands and expectations, ex., on people. Makes it difficult, even if you know exactly what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a problem beyond HW.
        <br />
        I don't have enough info to assess that. Resource constraints are common. At Hitachi, they had that in spades. Single person bottlenecks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Replacements would have to be self-training.
        <br />
        &quot;So we put it on the shelf.&quot;
        <br />
        Pressure from sales guys... &quot;have to do this...&quot;....
        <br />
        ..Symantec 2nd stint was called in to recalibrate project, re-estimate it, etc., ... aggressive plan, trying to retain as much of earlier commitment as possible.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <font>
         * have you help org's move towards normal business process?
         <font>
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <font>
           * have you worked with a team of PjMs? in a PMO?
           <font>
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <font>
             * We need a really quick start from this incumbent.&nbsp; Can you give me an example where you picked up a project and hit the ground running? How?
             <br />
             <font>
              <br />
              <br />
              <font>
               * How was scheduling managed at the organizational level at a previous job? How did you fit in?
               <font>
                <br />
                <br />
                - I have thoughts. Sounds like people are split across multiple projects, and not loaded properly. 100% of same person on multiple projects?
                <br />
                - Wrk estimates must be disciplined, with some confidence estimates
                <br />
                - need a means of prioritizing across projects. Need accurate resource loading.
                <br />
                - you need a consolidated master schedule. You can do a variety of ways. MS Project server does it.&nbsp; PPM tools, like one we used at Hitachi (&quot;Changepoint&quot;).&nbsp; Need to review time phasing.
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                * DIrect customers contact?
                <br />
                - Extensive. FIrst half of my career had a lot of full-life cycle support, visits.
                <br />
                My PM career has centered around internal customer (i.e., &quot;IT projects&quot;). So my customer is a Senior VP, for instance.
                <br />

                <br />
                <br />
                <font>
                 * Think about a difficult customer you have had.
                 <br />
                 How did you manage them? What could you have done better?
                 <font>
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <font>
                   * Think about a difficult colleague you had, who was a needed resource. How did you handle it?
                   <font>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - Of course, maybe &quot;I&quot; was the colleague!
                    <br />
                    I haven't had that many difficult peers. I've had difficult reports. Ex, personality quirks, poor interpersonal skills, that wear on the team. Intermural conflict.&nbsp; Will take it to the individual person, and have a dialog.&nbsp; Ex., brilliant, sarcastic engineer. Pissed off customers.&nbsp; I explained that he was undermining himself, and gave him concrete examples.
                    <br />
                    I've had to negotiate maturely with our peers - that's a competition. If we have a clear sense of business priority, it's not hard.
                    <br />
                    I've had good luck in my PjM career. hasn't had that so much. Have had a difficult 3rd party vendor.

  <br />
  <br />
  =====
  <br />
  <br />
  Take: Seems good.&nbsp; a little less customer-facing experience, but nothing I'd fear.
  <br />
  Thoughtful, articulate. Probably a good fit.
  <br />
  <br />
  FUTURE QUEX:
  <br />
  * how would you chracterize yourself as a program manager?
  <br />
  <br />
  - somewhere between really agressive and realaly passive
  <br />
  <br />
  - very experienced with pulling requirements together, analyzing, breaking down, and tracking
  <br />
  <br />
  - no longer feels he's a &quot;technologist&quot;, he stopped keeping up at .net, skipped &quot;MVC&quot;, etc.
  <br />
  <br />
  - JP Morgan w2nd stint was too much banker rather than programmer focus.
  <br />
  <br />
  * ADP experience probably most applicable Large %&nbsp; was Pjm. MS Project.&nbsp; &quot;I love it.&quot;
  <br />
  Haven't used the financial stuff. Costing.
  <br />
  Resource mgmt. = set up scheduls; assign to tasks w/schedules;&nbsp; view utilization; Level by resource
  <br />
  = the MS Project &quot;feed the beast&quot; problem. Used project server, I imported the hours daily from my team. Kept tasks floating (not anchoring!).&nbsp; compliance - &quot;If you have a big enough whip!&quot;
  <font>
   They reported Hours on each project, AND the % remaining.
   <font>
    &nbsp; Built in to MS Project server itself.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    ===
    <br />
    Eric
    <br />
    team lead and coder
    <br />
    pretty smart, architected and coded big Stanford project. Worked for Bill
    <br />
    <br />
    Stubborn sometimes if customers wanted to change spec's. Dev teams were fine with him.
    <br />
    <br />
    articulate
    <br />
    organized
    <br />
    hard worker.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    ===
    <br />
    Yes, he worked for me the whole time I was at Context. He also worked with Eric and Eric has some opinions about him that would be worth checking. Pretty smart guy and definitely been around IT for a long time. He was part of the team I had working on the big project for Barry Reuter (Stanford Housing &amp; Dining).
    <br />
    <br />
    Talk with Eric about him while I think about him. He might be good as a contract person to get us through some projects for a while.
    <br />
    <br />
    Bill
    <br />
    <br />
    ===================================================================================
    <br />
    * ask about people skills (patience, difficult coworkers, resource constraints)
    <br />
    Difficult customer:
    <br />
    Stanford Project at Context Integration. Some difficult customers. Ever-changing requirements, pie-in-the-sky design. I tried to be patient, and listen, and coaching.&nbsp; Understanding what was possible.
    <br />
    Used to do quite a bit of documentation, to help to the SOW's.&nbsp; Try to get consensus.
    <br />
    <br />
    Difficult coworker: woman who was my nemesis for a while.&nbsp; Had an executive coach at the time, who coached me through it. He recommended I envision her with her family, as a mother, being a human being, not just nasty. See her value.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I did a lot of visualization.&nbsp; It helped quite a bit! x2.&nbsp; I was more empathetic to her eneds, etc.
    <br />
    <br />
    * how does he feel about direct customer contact?
    <br />
    BG: I've had a fair amount of customer-like contact. at perquest, ADP, travelseek I had a product manager, who represented the customer to development.&nbsp; I had finance and marketin and operations reporting as customers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did at Stanford, too.
    <br />
    <br />
    As an ongoing proposition, I'm fine with it.&nbsp; IT would be good to b able to deal directly with customers.
    <br />
    <br />
    =====================================
    <br />
    <br />
    BG: Organizational change -
    <br />
    <br />
    - examples of times he felt good/didn't re: customer management...
    <br />
    <br />
    ==PMI
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    * ask about project management per se (ex., &quot;PMI&quot;-like; loathe to say &quot;waterfall&quot;)
    <br />
    <br />
    CSM
    <br />
    <br />
    ============================
    <br />
    <br />
    * recnelty worked at perquest. SaaS payroll. 1st hire.
    <br />
    * Software dev (C#, asp, etc), three jobs-
    <br />
    Source control model expert, release management work (including scripting)
    <br />
    Configuring QA an dproduction environemnt
    <br />
    Project managing offshore team on flexible spending
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    [very articulate; like the QA/release planning]
    <br />
    <br />
    Whiel at ADP, reengineered dev process. From ad hoc, to planned. put in place
    <font>
     Change Review Board.
     <font>
      <br />
      ... created model of queue of work in progress and to do; when change were introduced, I could introduce the changes into the model;
      <br />
      Implemented project server; automated updates to teams, etc. Near real-time model of what was goign on with my teams.
      <br />
      * also did a lot of pjm at ADP. Hundreds of small projects on his plan.
      <br />
      * at ADP did RUP (I called it Agile)
      <br />
      * a lot of itneresting.
      <br />
      * My future is technical management
      <br />
      <br />
      RUP: I like it. Used to like it quite a bit. now I like Scrum better. I like the iterative nature. You don't need te monolithic document.
      <br />
      Like Scrum better because has more well-defined process, with less ceremony and paperwork.
      <br />
      Limitations of scrum: 7+/-2; need dedicated product owner;

  * Trajectory?
  <br />
  <br />
  I grew up professionally with the internet.
  <br />
  <br />
  Waterfall doesn't work. $1m disaster/ Out of date, bloated, over priced
  <br />
  <br />
  I got the PMI training, 3 days with slideshow.
  <br />
  &quot;I find the standard modes of training to be woefully inadequate&quot;
  <br />
  <br />
  ITIL has its own strong training programming.&nbsp; Certified
  <br />
  At misys we were all ITL. But ITIL was the waterfall.
  <br />
  Very cumbersome stuff.
  <br />
  <br />
  BH: &quot;In what contexts doesn't Agile work?&quot;
  <br />
  <br />
  <font>
   [none...] &quot;Agile is simplified lean.&quot;
   <font>
    &nbsp; On a few teams won't benefit
    <br />
    <br />
    BH: delivered to external deadlines?&nbsp; template projects (like migrations)?
    <br />
    <br />
    Working at cisco, on &quot;facebook&nbsp; for the corporation&quot;. Lots of external partners for documentum.&nbsp; Agile worked well.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Fortune: My impression was that this was for an Agile project manager.
    <br />
    Like many Agilistas, i'm not interested. I DON&quot;T DO WATERFALL AND WOULDN'T BE INTERESTED
    <br />
    &quot;I have a profound love of agile, and always champion its use.&quot;
    <br />
    <font>
     &quot;So I suggest we just end this conversation now....&quot;
     <br />
     <br />
     ACTION: I said i would clarify my understanding of the job description. blah blah

     TELL RON

      <br />
      <br />
      What a pompous twit.
      <br />
      <br />
      * Interest in HW?
      <br />
      <br />
      * where does scrum apply? where not?
      <br />
      <br />
      * what are you looking to do with your career? next?

                      Mahesh is a software engineer who has taken up project management in his last three jobs. I'm forwarding two resumes for him - given the odd job titles various companies have and the recent economy, it may take both to figure that out - to see that he spent 3 years project managing web apps in the mortgage industry (his second-last job) - and even then you may not see that he spent a year in a UC Santa Cruz program getting a PjM certification. I've spoken with him via phone; Margo, Xenia and I concur he's worth interviewing.�

  Hi Val,
  <br />
  <br />
  Here is my recent experience of working with mobile apps.
  <br />
  <br />
  I have done two projects directly developing mobile apps. In addition,
  <br />
  I have documented functional requirements for one mobile app. I have
  <br />
  worked on a Project with SMS push solution. The details are as
  <br />
  follows:
  <br />
  <br />
  1. Mobile App Project: ISsquared, Inc 2011. As part of the IT
  <br />
  integration project, a mobile app for Windows Mobile was built as an
  <br />
  internal social networking app. The app was to connect with the
  <br />
  internal (intranet) social networking site that shared informal info
  <br />
  for internal job openings and other items.
  <br />
  2. Mobile App Project: Global IT Partners, Inc 2009-2010. Involved in
  <br />
  the project of improving the IPhone App for Yahoo Shopping.
  <br />
  3. Mobile App Project/ Wrote Functional Requirements: ISsquared, Inc
  <br />
  2010. Wrote the FRD for the mobile app. The project was later shelved.
  <br />
  4. SMS push to Mobile Phones: ISsquared, Inc: The website project
  <br />
  involve the mass SMS push solution to mobile phones.

               DS:&nbsp; at Exodus, there were multiple departments who had to sign off on a project. Systems, file storage, facilities etc etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these areas were bottlenecks.
               <br />
               Used Siebold CRM. We used ticketing system in Siebold.&nbsp; Ticket went from one department to the next.&nbsp; We had notion of &quot;turnover time&quot;, time to complete a standard action. Sort of internal SLA.&nbsp; Provided range of days for all standard actions.&nbsp; Naturally serialized b/c of the product provisioning.&nbsp; But these were standardized tasks.
               <br />
               Development tasks still need estimates. And you have to monitor and check.

  January 2011 update
  <br />
  <br />
  The release user comments indicate there are some meaningful bugs (ex., w/permissions)

  <br />
  dotProject is built using
  <b>
   <font>
    free
   </font>
  </b>
  <font>
   open-source applications and is produced and maintained by a small, but dedicated group of volunteers.
   <br />
   dotProject is programmed in PHP, and utilises MySQL for a backend database (although other databases such as Postgres could also be used).
   <br />
   <br />
   Our recommended server platform includes Apache 1.3.27, PHP 4.2+, and
   <b>
    <font>
     MySQL
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    .
    <br />
    <br />
    In the spirit of free, peer-reviewed, open source application development, we would also encourage you to use an operating system such as
    <b>
     <font>
      Linux
     </font>
    </b>
    <font>
     , FreeBSD, or OpenBSD. However, additional operating systems such as Windows, Mac, and other flavours of *nix are also supported.

   I am going to create a 3 week trial account for you on Project.net.&nbsp; If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
   <br />
   <br />
   Please go to login.project.net and select the registratoin link at the right of the page.&nbsp; When prompted to enter a license key, please enter:
   <br />
   2-9ASNW-3EFA3-APUK2-7TYP4
   <br />
   <br />
   There is context sensitive help in the application on the upper right of each screen. Here are some helpful links:
   <br />
   1) Beta FAQ:
   <a href="http://faq-beta.project.net/">
    http://faq-beta.project.net/
   </a>
   <br />
   2) Link to version 9.0 documentation (currently being updated):
   <a href="http://doc.project.net">
    http://doc.project.net
   </a>
   <br />
   <br />
   Warm Regards,
   <br />
   Tim
   <br />
   <br />
   PS Adding people to the trial:
   <br />
   You can add people with the license key above. The best process is to add all users to a single high level business. To do this:
   <br />
   1) Select/create a business
   <br />
   2) Select the directory menu item (top of page)
   <br />
   3) Select 'Invite Member&quot; in the left hand menu
   <br />
   4) Enter first name, last name, email at the top right of the page
   <br />
   5) Select the down arrow next to the user email (repeat if needed)
   <br />
   6) Select &quot;Add New Invitees&quot; at the bottom of the page
   <br />
   7) Select �administrator� for rights
   <br />
   8) Select �invite� at the bottom right of the page
   <br />
   <br />
   Adding people to a project is similar.
   <br />
   1) Complete through step 3 (above) for a project (rather than a business)
   <br />
   2) On the left of the page, search on the high level business that you added (above)
   <br />
   3) At this point you can select users using a checkbox option.

   Thank you for your recent inquiry about Project.net.&nbsp; Here are the answers to some of your questions:
   <br />
   1) The cost is $250/named user/year.&nbsp; This is a support fee (we do not charge for licenses -
   <b>
    <font>
     20% educational discount
    </font>
   </b>
   <font>
    can be taken off price.
    <br />
    2) Unlimited workflows are allowed
    <br />
    3) We do have integrated bug tracking through our custom tracking databases (forms).&nbsp; We do not integrate with subversion.
    <br />
    4) We can do cross project reporting.&nbsp; Detailed reporting of this fashion
    <font>
     would likely use our Pentaho integration
     <font>
      <br />
      5) You are able to archive projects without deleting the data
      <br />
      6) There are
      <font>
       public APIs we are working to expand what currently exists
       <font>
        <br />
        7) Customers could submit tickets throught the system but not follow them
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Could you confirm the expected number of users, budget constraints, expected deployment date, and the major issues you hope to address?
        <br />
        <br />
        I look forward to helping make your initiative a success. Please let me know the next steps you would like to take.
        <br />
        <br />
        Best Regards,
        <br />
        Tim
        <br />

  I represent a software development unit of Stanford University. We're interested in learning more about your product, educational pricing, and perhaps trial access. We have approximately 150 employees, and are interested in project management, resource management, bug and feature tracking, and related matters.&nbsp; We are not an Oracle shop (we do Sybase), and so may be interested in a hosted solution. (Oracle Express looks interesting, but I can't tell if the data limits are low, given how project.net uses it.)
  <br />
  Among our initial questions:
  <br />
  <br />
  What is the licensing model: per user, �concurrent user� model, etc.
  <br />
  How many workflows can be created?
  <br />
  Can you integrate the bug tracking system with Subversion (which we use for code control)?
  <br />
  Can you do cross-project reporting?
  <br />
  Can you archive projects without physically deleting the data?
  <br />
  Are there public API�s? (I believe the answer is &quot;yes&quot;)
  <br />
  Could we offer a Customer &quot;portal&quot; (i.e., so customers could submit and view their tickets, but not other data)
  <br />
  <br />
  I will be away from the office Monday and Tuesday, but will try to check e-mail. Many thanks for your assistance.

  You explicitly state that Easy Projects .NET is an software project management tool. What makes this product especially suited for SOFTWARE project management?
  <br />
  There are plenty of &quot;fits all sizes&quot; project applications with millions of features. In contrast Easy Projects has only those tools and features that you need to manage your software project. Not engineering, not construction, just software. No bells and whistles � usual software project managers just don't have time to spend on learning sophisticated products.
  <br />
  Easy Projects .NET was initially developed as an internal software project management tool and has gradually evolved into a commercial product. Before introducing any new feature or module to the public, Logic Software first deploys this piece of code within our own company and works with it for a while to make sure that it's easy to use.

    Being a Project Manager isn�t the easiest job in the world and it poses several interesting challenges for individuals and organizations alike.

                                    Choosing a web-based project management tool best-suited to your organization�s needs can often be a daunting task. A tool that works perfectly for Project A may be overkill for Project B and there�s no one size fits all rule that works just as well for all projects. Unless you are an enterprise user, VersionOne would probably be an overkill. If you are looking for a self-hosting version, LiquidPlanner, PivotalTracker and LiquidPlanner are non-starters. Further, apart from 2Plan Team, each of the other tools reviewed has significant budgetary implications as well. If you are looking for an open-source web-based project management tool with powerful third-party integration capabilities, we recommend that you explore 2Plan Team. Coming at the best possible price � FREE, it�s surely worth a try.

   <br />
   Paul,
   <br />
   Can you bring your laptop and demo us the product you�ve been using?
   <br />
   <br />
   Bernard,
   <br />

   to find out the price. Can you also ask them few more questions which can help us identify if this is the right tool for us?
   <br />
   Questions:
   <br />
   What is the licensing model: per user or �concurrent user� model?
   <br />
   How many workflows can be created?
   <br />
   Can you integrate bug tracking system with Subversion?
   <br />
   Can you do cross-project reporting?
   <br />
   Can you archive projects without physically deleting the data?

  <br />
  AL
  <br />
  <br />
  I completed some preliminary testing of the Replicon systems today
  <br />
  with mixed results. I'll say the testing has lead to much frustration,
  <br />
  although I'll acknowledge that I haven't spent much (ok, any) time
  <br />
  ready the manuals. (I hate manuals.)
  <br />
  <br />
  I started with WebResource, creating a project
  <br />
  (Migration_TestLoadToTimeSheet), creating some tasks, assigning them,
  <br />
  etc. I subsequently sent that project to TimeSheet and tried to
  <br />
  interact with that project there. I found the later operation
  <br />
  confusing and ultimately confounding, although I didn't spend much
  <br />
  time trying to troubleshoot it. I'll return to that, but in the
  <br />
  meantime I thought I'd report on my WebResource experience...
  <br />
  <br />
  I think the greatest benefit of the experience was that it helped me
  <br />
  define
  <b>
   <i>
    <font>
     <font>
      my mental model
     </font>
    </font>
   </i>
  </b>
  <font>
   of how I think the system should work. I would
   <br />
   expect:
   <br />
   <br />
   * I set up a project (potentially based on a template) that includes
   <br />
   phases, tasks, and effort estimates (measured in hours) for those
   <br />
   tasks
   <br />
   * I set a project start date. The system schedules all follow on tasks
   <br />
   and deliverables accordingly assuming 100% allocation of resources.
   <br />
   * I assign staff to the project and set an allocation.
   <br />
   * I assign staff to particular tasks.
   <br />
   * Given those assignments, project allocations, and effort estimates
   <br />
   the system returns a modified schedule
   <br />
   * Modifications could be iterative, ie a PjM could setup a project
   <br />
   based on a template. I could enter my assignments and allocations. The
   <br />
   schedule would self-adjust. Subsequently Margo could enter her
   <br />
   assignments and allocations. The system would adjust again. These
   <br />
   adjustments would take into consideration task dependencies as well.
   <font>
    <br />
    <br />
    I'd be curious to hear other's reactions to this model.
    <br />
    <br />
    Replicon WebResource does not work according to my model.
    <br />
    <br />
    An area of particular frustration to me was the reporting/resolution
    <br />
    of conflicts between task duration and allocation. I
    <br />
    <br />
    * defined task with duration of 5 working days; this assignment is to
    <br />
    5 specific days, not to any 5 days (or 40 hours)
    <br />
    * assigned a resource to that task with an allocation of 40%. (note
    <br />
    that allocation is by task rather than project, which seems
    <br />
    counterintuitive to me)
    <br />
    * clicked &quot;Calculate Duration&quot; and it extended the task duration
    <br />
    beyond the scheduled duration and issues an &quot;!&quot; followed by a warning
    <br />
    at the top of the page which noted the duration now extends beyond the
    <br />
    scheduled time frame but that extension didn't seem to &quot;cascade&quot; to
    <br />
    subsequent tasks/dependencies
    <br />
    * I returned to the project calendar and the duration of that task had
    <br />
    stretched to accurately reflect the assigned allocation, but there was
    <br />
    no (visual) indication that this wasn't per original (template)
    <br />
    schedule (other than the fact that the task now overlaps with others,
    <br />
    although this wouldn't necessarily signal a problem)
    <br />
    * The project calender accurately reflects overlapping tasks but
    <br />
    doesn't visually indicate that that might be a problem.
    <br />
    <br />
    I know that's a lot to digest. I hope my bullet-point account
    <br />
    <br />
    Also, almost any operation requires one to scroll to the bottom of the
    <br />
    page and click &quot;Save&quot;. This makes is easy to lose work, I think. (And
    <br />
    this gets to Bernie's earlier point that this isn't AJAX.) It's
    <br />
    annoying to assign tasks, see what you want on the screen, and to have
    <br />
    to remember to explicitly save it. I lost several tasks and
    <br />
    assignments because I forgot to do that.
    <br />
    <br />
    OK, time for some soup...
    <br />

  Hi Bernard,
  <br />
  �� I noticed that you have just user access.
  <br />
  Now I have given jira-admin and jira-developer access as well.
  <br />
  <br />
  In the DemoTrialDummy project, you can create and do anything. You have full access to it.
  <br />
  There seems to be limited security flexibility to provide a user with just read access. At least I do not know about it.
  <br />
  <br />
  Now I have enabled accept remote API calls. It is turned off by default.

   Nope, no official checklist, but here's what I do:
   <br />
   <br />
   * alert customer to project go-live, and explain that:
   <br />
   &nbsp; -- you're on point for ~2 more weeks
   <br />
   &nbsp; -- they should continue to add feedback to the GooDoc
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; during that period
   <br />
   &nbsp; -- following that period, they should send feedback
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directly to their PbM as the GooDoc will be retired
   <br />
   <br />
   * field customer feedback for ~2 weeks following go-live
   <br />
   <br />
   * work with project team to resolve feedback during that
   <br />
   &nbsp; period; any items that seem more like customizations or
   <br />
   &nbsp; new development than bug fixes should be referred to
   <br />
   &nbsp; the PbM for follow-up
   <br />
   <br />
   * at the end of the 2-week period, move unresolved
   <br />
   &nbsp; feedback into QuickBase (including the customization /
   <br />
   &nbsp; development requests noted above), leaving QB task #s
   <br />
   &nbsp; in the comments field to make it easy to move back and
   <br />
   &nbsp; forth between the tools
   <br />
   <br />
   * assign content bugs to Xenia; assign all other bugs to
   <br />
   &nbsp; site-support
   <br />
   <br />
   * for bugs that you are in the best position to track,
   <br />
   &nbsp; assign yourself as Task Owner
   <br />
   <br />
   * prepend the word &quot;RETIRED&quot; to the GooDoc spreadsheet
   <br />
   &nbsp; name so folks are aware / reminded of its status
   <br />
   <br />
   * facilitate debrief with project team to discuss the
   <br />
   &nbsp; migration and review outstanding feedback items, as
   <br />
   &nbsp; appropriate; this can happen during the first or second
   <br />
   &nbsp; week following migration
   <br />
   <br />
   * ensure that PbM is aware (A) when the PMO is no longer
   <br />
   &nbsp; in the lead on the project, (B) where they can find all
   <br />
   &nbsp; outstanding feedback items (in which QB project), (C)
   <br />
   &nbsp; of the status of all instances of #B, and (D) that they
   <br />
   &nbsp; are responsible for prioritizing the bugs on behalf of
   <br />
   &nbsp; the customer
   <br />
   <br />
   NOTE: I typically create a new QB project myself and then add migration
   <br />
   tasks therein, but in reality PbMs might prefer being asked whether
   <br />
   they're OK with that, or if they'd rather have you add migration-related
   <br />
   tasks to an existing project.

  STRATEGY FOR SHOEHORNING

  * ask Christine to take back AAP. She's very involved in its execution anyway. Get AdV back

  * RSMP migration - may not go forward soon, if their design people decide to veto

  RL: We need to assign the BIG ROCKs first. And then if we have 15% migrations, the PbMs may have to eat those.

                   <br />
                   &quot;Jneuro has some upcoming articles that contain audio snippets. On the display, they want to have a figure call out that the user can click on to hear the audio. Our system needs to use a media player that supports various audio formats.

    Margo's comments. Overall, she rubber stamped almost all of our ratings.
    <br />
    Where she suggested adjustments, the were on the order of 5%.&nbsp; Her
    <br />
    concerns about GSW are no surprise.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    * COB m BIology Open - at least we've work for COB recently.&nbsp; Launched
    <br />
    JOCES and JEXBIO in April. Difficult, but we did.
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;AdeV: I'm not sure I understand Margo's comments. We don't have a PjM
    <br />
    for this one, do we? Is she saying that the launch should be less
    <br />
    difficult because we've got their other sites on H2O already, perhaps?
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;BH: Yeah, she's saying &quot;at least we've done some H2o sites with COB
    <br />
    already.&quot; That's all.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    * STKE 30% ok NOW, higher if we go Drupal rollout.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    * JCO could be less
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    * RSMP&nbsp; - challenging. Could be&nbsp; 40%.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suite, with differences between
    <br />
    sites. Also, work ongoing in H10.&nbsp; New feature being developed ofr H2O
    <br />
    launch
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;AdeV: I can see the wisdom in upping it to 40%. I'm not remembering
    <br />
    what the new feature is that's being developed, though, which is troubling
    <br />
    since this is my project. I'll take a look.
    <br />
    <br />
    UPDATE: I think this may be the installation of xPDF at the time of
    <br />
    migration ... I'm not seeing an actual &quot;launch&quot; project in the works for
    <br />
    this customer, anyway. I'll touch base with Margo tomorrow to make sure I
    <br />
    understand what this &quot;new feature&quot; really is.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    * ASHAJNLS/ASHASIG together are less than 40%; maybe 35% (20% for the
    <br />
    major titless, 15% for newsletters.)
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;AdeV: I'm happy to go with her lower estimate. I think we also
    <br />
    speculated that some efficiencies could be gained if the same PjM tackled
    <br />
    them together.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    * ASHS - the umbrella makes it 20% rather than 15%
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;AdeV: Upping this to 20% makes good sense. (Rich's RCPsych is a 3 site
    <br />
    + 1 umbrella project, and it's already at 20%.)

    -----------------
    <br />
    * GSW - Caution! trouble.&nbsp; GSW pre-requirements (with Rich) should be
    <br />
    ultra-high priorities. MK doesn't expect problems. Maybe yucky old
    <br />
    content, though.
    <br />
    GSW mig has to be coordinated with migration of parent sites that have
    <br />
    to happen ahead of time. So paleos, sepm, canmin, econgeo, ssabull,
    <br />
    jsedres&nbsp; need to migrate before end of september.
    <br />
    Has to be coordinated with content transition work that hasn't happened yet
    <br />
    Mirror site needs to be implemented for the first time in H20.
    <br />
    Some custom work.s
    <br />
    So MK suggests 50%.
    <br />
    New GSW launching site with date of November, which will slip. Unless we
    <br />
    have cycles to deal with this new Italian rocks journal.
    <br />
    GSW portal is not being done at the same time. Separate project.
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;AdeV: Yes, moving from 45% to 50% sounds reasonable to me. Always
    <br />
    better to cushion rather than hope for smooth sailing. When we spoke last
    <br />
    about GSW, Margo indicated that she thought the launch should be handled
    <br />
    in parallel by the migration team; has she changed her mind about that?
    <br />
    Has she spoken with LindaT, do you know?
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;BH: I do not know. She did say &quot;unless we have the cycles...&quot; so maybe
    <br />
    she was still entertaining the notion.
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;AdeV: OK. I'll ask her about that when I meet with her tomorrow
    <br />
    morning.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    BIR - MK: why 25%, rather than less?&nbsp; I couldn't remember.
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;AdeV: I'm happy to reset this one at 20% (3 sites + 1 umbrella) if
    <br />
    Margo agrees; I don't recall why I thought this would be more challenging
    <br />
    than a typical multi-site migration.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    Inline audio - Thought Bill might want to contract to Andrea L?
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    -----------------
    <br />
    CHEST Meeting abs - Doesn't seem to MK to need a PjM.
    <br />
    We had problems last year, moving from meeting abstracts into CHEST site
    <br />
    itself.&nbsp; But now it's done.&nbsp; Between Chris Abbott and Bryan or Chris C,
    <br />
    PjM work won't be excessive.&nbsp; Leave with PbM?
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;AdeV: Jean specifically requested a PjM, but if we don't got one,
    <br />
    hearing that this shouldn't be too difficult to manage makes it less
    <br />
    painful to try to push this one back.
    <br />
    <br />
    --&gt;BH: yes. and Margo actually volunteered to speak with her.

   I think, at this point, we've been taking on out of plan new items and
   <br />
   everything else that it would probably be foolish at this point to not grant
   <br />
   a one day reprieve.&nbsp; We should have been hardnosed from the beginning, but
   <br />
   we weren't so for a day, it would be silly to make a big deal out of a day,
   <br />
   now.
   <br />
   <br />
   Next time (w/them or anyone else)
   <font>
    we need to lock down the
    <br />
    Requirements at the beginning and then put it under change control.&nbsp; ANY (yes, ANY!!!) change from the originally &quot;frozen&quot; Requirements requires change control approvals from both sides.&nbsp; My expectations on any change is that there will be a cost, nothing is free (time and/or resources).&nbsp; We need
    <br />
    to be disciplined from the start.

  RS: Jiawei... books branch so far out of date, 1st gen code
  <br />
  H2O books...
  <br />
  <br />
  Books modeled as H2O books:
  <br />
  ERM, aptaguide, sepm (4 series); Another set coming in october
  <br />
  <br />
  Journal and book platforms are now out of sync, books are 18 months out of sync. Two different codebases.&nbsp; Books was originally a hacked journal branch.
  <br />
  Pain in the ass to do. We need a better way.
  <br />
  <br />
  Vision was always to merge books back in.
  <br />
  <br />
  RS: It would be months of someone's work to reinterate. And we'd still be in danger of breaking.
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ:&nbsp; I think we want these products to diverge. But there is commonality.&nbsp; Could there be an abstract layer, that each have as an external...?
  <br />
  RS: no, books content was so different. Low level, getting content differences....
  <br />
  RS: Not full featured, not great, etc.
  <br />
  <br />
  AB: So we're months of gettign this fixed
  <br />
  CJ: It's not a problem that they products will drift.&nbsp; Cut the cord. DIfferent products.
  <br />
  Niz: Forking is common. But danger is lowest common denominator functionality. That tips scale re: buy vs build.
  <br />
  <br />
  NN: The processing pipeline is the same situation.&nbsp; Critical distinction Journals 2.3 dtd, Books started on 3.0.&nbsp; Never extended to 3.0 journal dtd's.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  RS: We can go forward, doing with what we've been doing for now.
  <br />
  <br />
  AB: ppt downloading, reflinks, are part of what differentiates us , value we get from the journal system.
  <br />
  RFPs keep asking for integrated books and journals.
  <br />
  <br />
  NN/RS: It's not anemic, it's nascent.
  <br />
  NN: the books workflow isn't bad, the loading code is working well. But Only I know how to use it.
  <br />
  <br />
  GS: Massive amounts of commonality.
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ: Right. You can support that via inheritance from abstract base;&nbsp; complete fork with copy and paste;&nbsp; or use a mixin approach for features (component library, calling on shared atom content; compose rather than inheritance, which I prefer)
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ: ex., reflinks should be a component.
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ: Any of these would be difficult.
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ: Pure H2O launch for smpte, is thin edge of wedge for getting off h1O. Ex., loading data into reflinks.
  <br />
  <br />
  GS: Ex, Google Plus won't go into books this weekend.
  <br />
  <br />
  Niz: split becomes wider - between reality and marketing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had no idea the split was this large.
  <br />
  We're selling commonality between book and journal, and we can't deliver now.
  <br />
  <br />
  RS: &lt; 6 months of a senior person, for example
  <br />
  <br />
  NN: in content, we'd probably like to refactor to shared model, but we'd keep the codebases separate.

    RL: SO?
    <br />
    CJ: Need investigation still. Could we leverage Brightcove.
    <br />
    BW: Brightcove won't support near term audio-only, so we should focus on Limelight.
    <br />
    <br />
    TM: BW to write spec (# publishers, what formats, how display), Matt to vet for video. Then to tech team.&nbsp; Delivery date for that first article.
    <br />
    RS: need to know if Limelight has a player, what my embedding parameters are etc.
    <br />
    <br />
    Limelight: streaming flash, streaming windows (RMTP)
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    KH: modeling currently is awkward, b/c the DTD doesn't permit accommodating all of the parameters that the display layer needs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So we have &quot;supplemental&quot; approach we have now.

  MJ: within 6 months they're pulling most books. May not be launching any more.

  MJ: No. Huge a/c Sage.

  MK: Not. I worked closely on informs. Not that strong.

  <br />
  <br />

  MK: Paul B can manage umbrella migrations

  Anh...

  HE's not at 100%.

  BH: and it's only a month.

  <br />
  <br />
  Linda A could take on the one launch?
  <br />
  MJ:&nbsp; et in Jan back to PbM group.&nbsp; On loan.&nbsp;&nbsp; But her skill set doesn't work. I can take her back, let her do ACLS, and bring her in as PbS.

  <br />
  <br />
  MJ: ET has already been here 4 years,

  micro has no a/c, few pages, one main content page;&nbsp; up to three total
  <br />
  (you don't consume micro )
  <br />
  <br />
  mini (not much demand), can have content, more a/c, features like video (you consume content on a mini) pod cast, image categoreis
  <br />
  <br />
  Matt has an &quot;order form&quot; to get things as preset as possible
  <br />
  <br />
  Matt is not convinced we haven't spec'ed a PjM.
  <br />
  <br />
  BH: THis doesn't seem to fit
  <br />
  <br />
  1 publisher = 4 or 8 hours.
  <br />
  <br />
  ========================
  <br />
  <br />
  Each order form will be unique
  <br />
  MR wants a image gallery of site styles
  <br />
  Customers will fill out an initital order form (structured, detailed), and then the project manager will generate a custom order form that they send to the customer to fill out.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  If they want custom, then it's macro...

  temis has given faichi their drupal code to start with
  <br />
  we'll use Temis SaaS until we have it up here (January?)
  <br />
  Requirements still with ProdMan
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  JAMS makeover is not scheduled
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Q2 - Relationship Manager update, fully spec'ed; H2O related article support
  <br />
  MK: What PNAS makes us do requires lots of H1O work, wastes labor.
  <br />
  BW: and we end up with multiple types of relationsihps on the same article apge.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Atom Store 2.0 investigation and design. Replace the constellatino of services that comprise &quot;content services&quot; -- MarkLogic, SASSfs, SASS
  <br />
  <br />
  SOA Platform - replacing H1O dependencies
  <br />
  business domain objects - users, subscriptions, alerts -- non content entities. We can only interact with via legacy systems.
  <br />
  Need unified strategy for middle-tier business services.&nbsp; Entangled Java code and DTL is our H1O SOA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom Angelopoulos plan. Work with Charleston Thai.
  <br />
  GEts completely defined&nbsp; in Q1 and used after that
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ: &quot;Developer sits down in front of Eclipse, Pushes this button..... Charleston takes and releases it.&quot;
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: federated search for JBJS is just start... it's mostly academic content only, we can use PubMed.
  <br />
  Viswa: spec due for jbjs-br phase 2 this month. We might not be able to get to all of it in Q1.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ: Faichi ... we're taking the Drupal work Temis developed, and we're taking 5,000 articles, and firing up temis drupal road show. Then we need tiem to dress it up.
  <br />
  JS: The competition is going in and doing demos with our data. We have to be able to do that!
  <br />
  <br />
  MR: Mobile ad service - now the Ammo (?) ad service alrmost ready. For those who want to do their own, we'll point them at Google, etc. Thrid part would be further in the future.
  <br />
  <br />
  ============
  <br />
  <br />
  Q2
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ: &quot;Shopping cart&quot; should probably replace PPV
  <br />
  <br />
  ==
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ: Microtagging - we're really dependent upon the standards org / google to fess up
  <br />
  <br />
  ===
  <br />
  <br />
  TM:&nbsp; Directors want us to develop a standard drupal-based site that will be used for all new sites. (!)&nbsp; Templated sites.
  <br />
  AB: more from steering committee
  <br />
  CJ: Investigation and trial!&nbsp; it's nto a demo. We need to figure out how to do it, and do one.
  <br />
  TM: has asked by Helen Sz if we can launch standard sites for
  <b>
   <font>
    ECS
   </font>
  </b>
  <font>
   June in drupal.
   <br />
   <br />
   ==
   <br />
   JS: productize anything from JBJS-BR ph1 or ph2? Or aap Portal2015
   <br />
   <br />
   ==
   <br />
   JS: Linked open data. Keller clearly expects us sto have something cooking there. Phil Schurr is. He wants data interfaces, etc. Better be on Road Map.
   <br />
   CJ: MK stuff is loosely specified right now.
   <br />
   <br />
   ====
   <br />
   <br />
   CJ: this quarter, we publish smpte standards as pure h20 book
   <br />
   In Q1, we look at aptabooks, erm, etc., and see what it woudl take to publish those in common, non-interleaved workflow
   <br />
   <br />
   For Q2, we have two choices.&nbsp; Can either continue on content publisher path, and get pure h2O publishing [a lot of work and risk]
   <br />
   OR, we can look at runtime dependencies on H1O (legacy H1O sites, services) i.e., the services,&nbsp;&nbsp; Shut down H1o sites. Still need Content db. Start turning off the Solaris machines, and get rid of HW Maint.
   <br />
   400 items of dependence on H2O.&nbsp; By end of Q2, all maint functionalities will be in by end of Q2. Leverages SOA.&nbsp; Leverages what's needed for Drupal, etc. Existing h2O sites will be refitted as well. Improves stability, lets us shut down 1500 applications.
   <br />
   <br />
   ===========
   <br />
   <br />
   TM: need a sane way of adding new data types for data supplements. Publisher e-mail, etc.&nbsp; Jeff O sends mail, 5 or 6 peopel or do their one thing, then we redeploy site, THEN they can add their new data type.
   <br />
   <br />
   CJ: we need a whole need content management tool for this stuff. DSM is yuckie.
   <br />
   Needs interface to HWX.
   <br />
   Need product to support ex. foreign language abstracts loading into the content db, not as data supp's. This is much easier in H2O store, but the product needs to be built.
   <br />
   <br />
   =============
   <br />
   <br />
   LP: { on access control APIs for RUP, need them for mobile app???}
   <br />
   TR: I need to know about this for BMJ trip Dec 2.
   <br />
   <br />
   LP: CSHL wants a drupal standard site.
   <br />
   <br />
   LP: PNAS, CSHL both do lots of data supplements, we need to improve over next couple of quarters.
   <br />
   <br />
   ===
   <br />
   <br />
   KH: HWX emerging road map. Will include giving customer ability to delete articles, do some other substantial actions they can't go now.
   <br />
   <br />
   ==
   <br />
   <br />
   AAP 2015, JBJSBR&lt; ASCO, all want us to integrate content from other sources. OUP went to iFactory to do books and Journals. We need an offering.
   <br />
   <br />
   ==
   <br />
   <br />
   Q3: m-sites are ok now. Would like to build &quot;community&quot; features for m-sites.
   <br />
   Q1-Q#: mobile version of umbrella sites.&nbsp; Mobile-specific pages
   <br />
   ===========
   <br />
   <br />
   Qx: CJ as we shut down H1O, move from Sybase to Oracle, we can als osimplify how we do development and host sites. Modernize.
   <br />
   <br />
   KH: Image processing needs work, too.
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
   TM: we should look into replacing FAST&gt;
   <br />
   CJ: Solr/Lucene coming in via several paths.
   <br />
   TM: Ex., like federated search.
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
   CJ: Alerts 1.5 will need to go to Alerts 2.0, which needs a spec. We should
   <b>

    <font>
     Direct marketing firms w/good tools.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use their tools,

     <br />
     LP: File Manager, needs embargoing.
     <br />
     <br />
     ========
     <br />
     <br />
     TM: Rule of thumb is Road Map shouldn't be more than 60% of our staff's capability.
     <br />
     <br />
     MC: We need a POR, planning of CRs, deployments,&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, we don't have a Plan of Record.
     <br />
     <br />
     ========================
     <br />
     <br />
     AB: a manager will be assigned to each, and then the manager will get resources assign, and report shortages.

   So I've put some more time in on staffing for the new year.&nbsp; I've been
   <br />
   relying on my new pal, Report 54
   <br />
   <br />
   <a href="https://www.quickbase.com/db/bgbjicgmb?a=q&amp;qid=17">
    https://www.quickbase.com/db/bgbjicgmb?a=q&amp;qid=17
   </a>
   <br />
   <br />
   The &quot;must assign&quot; section and the summary table, showing how booked
   <br />
   people are, is of most interest.
   <br />
   <br />
   I also did another scratch pad calcuation tab on
   <br />
   <br />
   <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/highwire.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuaAH4UwHIYbdHM3S3owdFJQVUdQOWNuOGpudWkwV3c&amp;hl=en_US#gid=2">

   </a>
   <br />
   <br />
   see the &quot;est 2&quot; tab.&nbsp; The&nbsp; &quot;FREE&quot; row and the&nbsp; &quot;must assign&quot; row are the
   <br />
   most interesting bits here.&nbsp; (Your % reflects the present OUP book load.)
   <br />
   <br />
   Here's the latest developments, plus my thought experiment for this
   <br />
   evening, I'd like your input, including full reality check.
   <br />
   <br />
   1. Phac and Dom both think JBJS-BR part 2 is at least 50% of a person.
   <br />
   I've upped it to that, with minor reservations.&nbsp; Phac has indicated he
   <br />
   would be willing to continue to work for HW @ 50%, perhaps 2 days a
   <br />
   week, or something like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not clear if Ron can get the funds, but
   <br />
   he's willing to try. I think the continuity on this extremely complex
   <br />
   project is work a lot.
   <br />
   <br />
   2. Especially if Ron wants to keep Phac on part time, we'll be losing
   <br />
   another PjM contractor.
   <br />
   <br />
   3. I don't fully understand what the OUP books decision means for your
   <br />
   schedule, starting when. Do&nbsp; you? Let's discuss tomorrow on our call. In
   <br />
   my sketch this evening, I gave you the Ed Book (AACR), Red Book (AAP),
   <br />
   and SAP Book (ASH). Is that a fair exchange for OUP? Not sure about
   <br />
   &quot;phasing out&quot;&nbsp; for OUP, etc. [Did you faint?]
   <br />
   <br />
   For the rest of the troops, here's where I came out:
   <br />
   <br />
   JBJS-BR2: Phac
   <br />
   GSW Portal: Tien
   <br />
   eCarlyle: BH
   <br />
   Meeting abstract sites: BH
   <br />
   AACR VJs: Gregory
   <br />
   ACLS migration: Ellen, or catch as catch can.
   <br />
   AdV: (ASH Ed &amp; AAP Red &amp; ASH SAP) book
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
   PNAS redesign is not staffed, b/c it hasn't been quoted yet. I did tell
   <br />
   Jean to include PjM $$$ if she wanted one.
   <br />
   <br />
   I'm a little concerned b/c CHOICE is going to run long, and BMJ might
   <br />
   (looking at the requested release schedule), so I might be overextended
   <br />
   in Jan/Feb, but it's hard to call for sure.
   <br />
   <br />
   Anyway, would you have a look, and lemme know if you think this adds up,
   <br />
   or not?
   <br />
   <br />
   Thank you as always, I hugely appreciate your insights on this stuff.

  TM: need mobile site that doesn't proxy from H1O, or we need an H2O shell site
  <br />
  A standalone mobile site is a roadmap for Q2
  <br />
  (article, FM pages, etc get proxied now)
  <br />
  <br />
  Q1, pull from a4d.
  <br />
  Q2 pilot (STKE not a good pilot)
  <br />
  <br />
  TC: Q1 delivery needed
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: ?? STKE isn't in H2O for Q1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Engineering didn't promise anything.
  <br />
  CC: Customer not driving?
  <br />
  BW: are.
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: You will not have an h2O site live in Q1.
  <br />
  Only thing that fits schedule is existing h2O site, that only uses their content. A private site to host content, and other required pages. Ron? Rachel?
  <br />
  RS: In theory that should work. But they do weird stuff.&nbsp; We could was a whooooole lot of time on a throwaway.
  <br />
  CJ: all the KE data ??? oh, not needed on Mobile.&nbsp;&nbsp; IF you leave the KE-extras out of it, and serve onlythe content, we can do that.
  <br />
  BW: John did not problem anything but the content.
  <br />
  <br />
  RS: Vanilla mobile, proxy H2O &quot;content&quot; site, cross fingers.
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: incorrect page number and dates, a flakey archive page - the things Matt/Dharm always sweat - will be an even bigger mess for STKE.
  <br />
  Once the content is loaded, we can just try this.
  <br />
  <br />
  TC to spec
  <br />
  <br />
  =======
  <br />
  <br />
  SMPTE SEARCH
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: nav can't be based on search. &quot;browse by&quot;. Spec exceeds what search can deliver.
  <br />
  Build a browse page purpose.
  <br />
  <br />
  Request was to use search to make a list of all articles of a particular type.
  <br />
  All standardas matching a particular criteria; then&nbsp; families; with individual standards; ....
  <br />
  <br />
  We could build a list for our list, like PAP page.
  <br />
  <br />
  TC: wanta to browse by 732.1 (if it's a family member) or 732. Wants to browse by the number range for that standard.&nbsp; Want to be able to browse &quot;0 to 50&quot;, etc.
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: So this result has two lists - the families, and the individual members.&nbsp; So we fire off multiple searches, and app's layer merges them.
  <br />
  <br />
  TC: Also, browse by topic, sent in metadata. Ex., &quot;camera&quot;.
  <br />
  <br />
  RS: or we cold build static pages
  <br />
  CJ: or we have a collection service, we coudl custom build particular indexes.
  <br />
  <br />
  CJ: I suggest we using existing collections (SMPTE standards are books;
  <br />
  top level collection f collections; atom store has top level collection of standards 9as book group). Needs blending.&nbsp; [explains combinatory logic]
  <br />
  Might want to create a service, which would be very cacheable, and never change until a new one was published
  <br />
  [families in one collection;&nbsp; standards in atom store] Algo based on standard name
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: sounds like you build a browsing app, based on existing collections
  <br />
  <br />
  RS/MK: That's a couple of weeks of work
  <br />
  ===================
  <br />
  <br />
  JBJSBR related article feature
  <br />
  <br />
  1 Specialty modeled as subject collection
  <br />
  2 search keywords
  <br />
  <br />
  No plan for anything on back issues
  <br />
  <br />
  PLT: How do we test this? we've asked for test content. 5 or 6 issues.
  <br />
  We don't have tool to make sure it's working well.
  <br />
  Resupply is only way to change anything.
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: They might want to add keywords to back content.
  <br />
  PLT: only two 2 will appear
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: for pub to permit edits to keywords in the atom store, and then kick off search reindexing
  <br />
  <br />
  PLT: and we'd have to avoid keywords getting overwritten by resupplies.
  <br />
  Until we have first results in hand, we don't know how much we need this or not. By early january, not much time left.
  <br />
  MK: This is a separate project, which they have decide they want, and will pay for.
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: Search engine provides its own heuristics for ordering results. Even if you had tool, it could take 15 minute after a change to see what the result is.
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: Interface, creates patch, which we post into the atom store. It then kicks off reindexing. And then it would have to clear one or more caches.
  <br />
  <br />
  TM: Estimate a week of work to get 80% there. THen Margo time. 6-8 days. off the cuff.

     Phac and Rama... said there woudl be QA people availalbe, but Phac never notified them that they were available. Miscommunication.&nbsp; Then Rama had no agent available on time.
     <br />
     MK: Caught up with Greg B, he woudl make time this week to do QA. And he'll compare with existing sties. And focus on the formatting of references, their big hot itme for 17 and 18.

      Customer complained ree:
      <br />
      - need to do a lot of QA of their own. Things would be fixed, then busted again.
      <br />
      - didn't follow mockups to the letter
      <br />
      - cross browser testing missed
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 2a. Why we had one; what was discussed; whether it
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was helpful; resulting action items.
      <br />

          TC:&nbsp; pretty well done with mapping our existing workflows.
          <br />

          Today meeting, found workflow issues that precede any attempt to set up Jira.&nbsp; We'll start first w/Single developer tasks (75% of our tasks).&nbsp;&nbsp; Directors meet about this on Monday.&nbsp; They'll look at who should be driving this, now that the issue has been surfaced.
          <br />
          <br />

          RL: We'll work from 75% up to the RFP level...
          <br />
          RL: MK and XPS recommendation is to make the technical owner the person who has the most work. So if Rachel has 80% of the work, but needs 20% from CJ, she has to get the work out of JD.

    Help for AB. PbM gets prototypes out the door, as it gets productized, others will do it.&nbsp; PbMs are not PjMs.

    <br />
    <br />
    TC: PL is a technical job doing the best he can, but we need an overall manager, just like Steve and Jira.

    I can't do that with SMPTE and Science at the same time.

   ASNR/ajnr: Any new concerns this morning about what you're finding in QA?
   <br />
   Is the goal still to have Alan complete content loading this week, after
   <br />
   QA finishes up their review today? Are you working with Bernard on this
   <br />
   one, and/or do you feel like you need any additional support in dealing
   <br />
   with either the PbM or the customer?
   <br />
   <font>
    <br />
    No new concerns as of now.�� Xenia wants Morgan to finish the QA today
    <br />
    before Alan starts loading the volumes.�� I am working with Bernard on this.
    <br />
    <font>
     <br />
     GSW/econgeo: I believe you said that you had customer approval on the
     <br />
     sample content. Did QA review the pan-era sample before Mike began
     <br />
     production loading? If so, were any problems reported? If not, let's talk
     <br />
     about how to deal with that. Looks like Mike has ~70 issues of ~840 loaded
     <br />
     to date. Has he confirmed that he will be content complete on 22 Sep, as
     <br />
     expected? Is the team ready to &quot;cut to prod&quot; on the 22nd, as well?
     <br />
     <font>
      <br />
      I will get an update from Mike Minarik to you on this.� We have a meeting at 1PM today.
      <br />
      <font>
       <br />
       SEPM/jsedres, palaios: Again, I believe you said that you had customer
       <br />
       approval on the sample content. Same question as above: has QA reviewed
       <br />
       the pan-era sample? Any problems? Looks like Mike has just 7 (5/jsedres +
       <br />
       2/palaios) of 565 (393 jsedres + 172 palaios) loaded to date. Has he
       <br />
       confirmed that he will be content complete on 22 Sep, as expected? Is the
       <br />
       team ready to &quot;cut to prod&quot; on the 22nd, as well?
       <br />
       <font>
        <br />
        <br />
        Update after Jsedres/Palaios/Econgeo/SSABull meeting:&nbsp; Deb is helping Mike Minarik by loading the content.
        <br />
        <br />
        Econgeo - content loading currently in progress -
        <br />
        Jsedres/Palaios - content loading to start after Econgeo - completion expected by Monday 9/26
        <br />
        <br />
        <font>
         <br />
         BSSA/ssabull: Sounds like the customer hasn't approved Beta, yet; is that
         <br />
         right? According to the schedule, we were supposed to have their approval
         <br />
         about a week ago. Can you update me on this one? We've lost about a week
         <br />
         of content loading time and there are ~514 issues to load.... Also, the
         <br />
         schedule indicates that we're supposed to cut to prod tomorrow, but if
         <br />
         launch has moved to 13 Oct I think we should cut to prod on 28 or 29 Sep,
         <br />
         instead. I'm confused! Please help.
         <br />
         <font>
          <br />
          Trying to get the customer signoff on beta and content.�� Had to clarify some
          <br />
          items today with them.� Expecting to get that today.
          <br />
          SSABull - Will start after Jsedres/Palaios.�� No completion date given by Mike.
          <br />
          <font>
           <br />
           ASH/bloodbook+umbrella: This one went to Beta yesterday, I believe. Please
           <br />
           let me know where I can find the feedback spreadsheet(s)!
           <br />
           <font>
            <br />
            Yes, also walked the publisher through the site notes and what is expected of
            <br />
            them during beta.
            <br />
            <font>
             <br />
             AJS/ajs: Did this go to Alpha this week? If so, please let me know where I
             <br />
             can find the feedback spreadsheet. Also, it looks to me like this journal
             <br />
             has yet to transition to NLM XML. Are you able to provide an update on
             <br />
             that work? I don't see any sample issues in HWX-demo/H1O-dev, and it looks
             <br />
             like it's still on the &quot;not firm&quot; tab here:

              content and Ramsi has received feedback on that.

   Thanks for getting the ball rolling on this; yes, Dom and Judith have

        <br />
        Some times based on importance and when I feel thorough professional QA is needed, I give alpha and beta to musikaar as well. Some times when local QA is on leave or busy with multiple tasks, I also assign alpha/beta to musikaar, if they are free.
        <br />
        <br />
        There is some value with local QA. There is a good value with remote QA. So I mix as appropriate.

        Hi Marc,
        <br />
        ��� Since formal QA is new at HighWire, publication managers may not have been fully conversant with the process/procedures of QA. Sometimes when Project Managers are involved, they handle all aspects of migration and launches. In such cases publication managers get less chance to be directly involved with QA process. But when publication managers also act as project managers, they have to adhere to QA process and use QA resources timely. In the last two months, I observed two instances of QA not being involved in migration as intended. So I thought I should send short email on QA processes so that publication managers can ensure QA processes are followed strictly.
        <br />
        <br />
        1.
        <b>
         <font>
          QA on alpha site
         </font>
        </b>
        <font>
         before publisher beta focusing mostly on loaded recent era NLM samples and specific design spec if sought by publisher and agreed to be done as part of migration. This
         <font>
          happens one week before publisher beta.
          <font>
           After samples are loaded by content analyst and JD prepares the site, the publication manager/project manager requests start of QA.
           <br />
           <br />
           2.
           <b>
            <font>
             QA on content site
            </font>
           </b>
           <font>
            for previous era samples and OM samples along with publisher beta. After the samples are loaded by the content analysts using content site prepared by the JD, the publication manager/project manager requests the start of content sample QA. This happens
            <font>
             two or three days after the start of publisher beta
             <font>
              . If it starts on the
              <i>
               <font>
                same day
               </font>
              </i>
              <font>
               as publisher beta, it is ideal. This needs to be done
               <font>
                before full content loading starts.
                <font>
                 <br />
                 <br />
                 3.
                 <b>
                  <font>
                   Pre-launch QA on beta site
                  </font>
                 </b>
                 <font>
                  supposed to start
                  <font>
                   two weeks before launch date.
                   <font>
                    QA will start this testing after getting an email from publication manager/project manager after all content is loaded, URL mapping is done and all the feasible changes are done to incorporate publisher feedback.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    4.
                    <b>
                     <font>
                      Launch day QA
                     </font>
                    </b>
                    <font>
                     . This is a short acceptance level of QA along with couple of tests that can happen� only after launch.
                     <br />
                     <br />
                     Since we have limited number of QA resources and two QA resources(Morgan Pugh, and Jessica Apperson) work part time while being full time students, I need prompt information on schedules and changes. QA requires two days of testing time and elapsed time of 1 week for the above 1, 2, 3 QA steps. Apart from these QA, QA also does OUP books QA, NLM transitions QA, and Installable QA prep to aid Publication Managers.
                     <br />
                     <br />
                     Thanks and regards,
                     <br />

  21:09 &lt;bh&gt; OK, I'll stick my neck out: does this technique work when there is no &quot;common&quot; character to swap? Ex., with a glyph gif? I assume .... not?
  <br />
  21:11 &lt;ian&gt; i set it up to be configurable to replace any character or string with any alternate (character, string, or markup)
  <br />
  21:11 &lt;ian&gt; so &quot;sure&quot;
  <br />
  21:11 &lt;ian&gt; the map is currently internal to the site, though, so we have to do a site update to change the character rewrite mapping
  <br />
  ...
  <br />
  21:15 &lt;bh&gt; you said &quot;is currently internal to the site...&quot; does that mean some day it might not be?
  <br />
  21:16 &lt;Rachel&gt; I assume that means it's a file living within tomcat, so tomcat needs to be restarted every time it's updated
  <br />
  21:16 &lt;ian&gt; yeah, we could move it out to staticfs so we could edit it live

  About the The Complete Project Management Office Handbook
  <br />
  The Handbook identifies the PMO as the essential integrator of the people, processes, and tools that manage or influence project performance. This book details how the PMO applies professional project management practices and successfully integrates business interests with project goals. The Handbook focuses on establishing PMO functionality to meet the requirements of project stakeholders. It presents 20 pertinent PMO function models, providing guidance for developing PMO operating capability that is applicable to any organization. It also presents these functions relative to five stages of progressive PMO development, demonstrating potential PMO growth from simple project control up through its alignment within a strategic business framework.

  Things that make problems for Scrum
  <br />
  <br />
  * External dependencies break Scrum.&nbsp; Sometimes they're a fact of life.
  <br />
  The more dependencies we try to manage in advance, the more we make ourselves un-agile.
  <br />
  <br />
  * Many to Many Relationships
  <br />
  multiple, interrelated teams (product, portfolio, development, etc).&nbsp; Each scrum team relies on those below.
  <br />
  Team velocity is not a predictor of higher order deliverables in this environment.&nbsp; (for integrated deliverables)
  <br />
  Common with SOA, etc. systems.
  <br />
  <br />
  Business-level agility: Team-like agility across the entire company. &quot;Enterprise backlog&quot;. Rapid feedback, iteration, etc.
  <br />
  <br />
  - love Scrum at team level. Otherwise you need some other things
  <br />
  <br />
  Tools available to scale Scrum
  <br />
  * Scrump and XP
  <br />
  * Kanban
  <br />
  * Lean - value streams, reducing waste, latency, cycle time
  <br />
  * Rational Unified Process (RUP). Excellent ideas on phasing and risk management
  <br />
  * Traditional SDLC&nbsp; (waterfall)
  <br />
  <br />
  What to organize teams around? Possible
  <br />
  * components
  <br />
  * services
  <br />
  ...
  <br />
  <br />
  Establish Program teams and/or Product Integration Teams, Portfolio Planning
  <br />
  - structures within org to build team around
  <br />
  + Manage the flow of value at each level.
  <br />
  Teams at bottom of pyramid focus on velocity.&nbsp; Mid-tier level might not have corresponding velocity, or a stable velocity - less predictable here.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Epic =&gt; Feature =&gt; User Story
  <br />
  Epic 1-3 mo, Features 2-4 wks, User Story 1-3 days (always fits in sprint)
  <br />
  deliver value early and often
  <br />
  <br />
  How do we relate team level velocity and enterprise flow of value?
  <br />
  Tier 3 - RUP [ Inception / Elaboration / Construction / Transition] (could be something other than RUP)
  <br />
  Tier 2 - Kanban [analysis / design / build / test / deploy]
  <br />
  Tier 1 - Scrum
  <br />
  <br />
  Wrap scrum in Kanban to create &quot;pull&quot; system across portfolio.
  <br />
  <br />
  ==============
  <br />
  <br />
  TC: We could use Kanban at the Migration level.&nbsp; Kanban reveals the bottlenecks.

   <br />
   PO should be role, not job title.
   <br />
   &quot;Discovery of the right thing to build is the most important step in creating a good product. Get that wrong and you have achieved 100% waste. Delegating decisions about what to build to a single Product Owner is outsourcing the most important work of the development team to a person who is unlikely to have the skills or knowledge to make really good decisions. The flaw in many Product Owner implementations is the idea that the Product Owner prepares detailed stories for the team to implement. This does not allow
   <font>
    team members to be partners
    <font>
     and collaborators in designing the product.&quot;

     KB: Product owners
     <br />
     <br />
     ==
     <br />
     <br />
     Aslam Khan:&nbsp; Product owners should provide opportunities for team to communicate direclty with customers, (mediated by PO, of course).
     <br />
     <br />
     PO should focus on &quot;what&quot;, but be prepared to talk about &quot;why&quot;
     <br />
     Team should focus on &quot;how&quot;, but also need to understand the business context.
     <br />
     <br />
     For AK, PO is less about feature and story framing, and more about tactical decision making to fulfill a strategy
     <br />
     <br />
     AK: feedback loops needs to be designed uniquely for each organization, and product, and strategy
     <br />
     <br />
     PO must be an info radiator (shareholders, investors, etc), as well as a sink
     <br />
     AK: I talk about Product Ownership (the role), not the Product Owner (a single person)
     <br />

     Most problems are contextual.
     <br />
     <br />
     Forget old rules that PO can't speak at standups. Etc.
     <br />
     <br />
     May need a &quot;backlog workshop&quot; once a week or every other, to do missing estimation, looking over the backlog for problems, etc.
     <br />
     <br />
     A &quot;Chief product owner&quot; might be useful in cross-team coordination .etc.&nbsp; And settle priorities across the team.
     <br />
     <br />
     Also supports multiple PO's (Role, not person). Sometimes two P(O's are good, one internal facing, the other external facing, - so long as they are attached back to back.

  <br />
  <br />
  * people are good estimators, so long as they are estimating within a single order of magnitude.&nbsp; Beyond that, we lose our way
  <br />
  <br />
  * basic math must hold to estimates: two &quot;4&quot; items should be same work as an &quot;8&quot;
  <br />
  relative sizing. Not duration.
  <br />
  <br />
  Duration comes out when we start measuring velocity.
  <br />
  <br />
  Estimate size: derive duration
  <br />
  <br />
  Time based estimates are not additive!&nbsp; That's why Mike likes story points.
  <br />
  My estimate might be based on my skill levels, which are different from yours. We can agree on the size of the task, but we will differ in getting it done.
  <br />
  <br />
  * You can't take hours you pulled out of the air (i.e., idealized hours in backlog), and compare them directly to hours you've &quot;thought a lot about&quot; (i.e., tasks hour estimated in the current iteration)
  <br />
  And you certainly can't divide the one into the other to get duration.

     <font>
      To calculate velocity, simply add up the estimates of the features (user stories, requirements, backlog items, etc.) successfully delivered in an iteration.

       How is velocity calculated?
      </font>
     </b>
     <font>
      <br />
      Velocity is the sum of the estimates of delivered (i.e., accepted) features per iteration.

        What unit is used to measure velocity?

      </b>
      <font>
       <br />
       Velocity is measured in the same units as feature estimates, whether this is story points, days, ideal days, or hours - all of which are considered acceptable.

  RL: Making it less and less appropriate for you
  <br />
  * experience working in every kind of house and housing development
  <br />
  * experience in so many places that nothing stymied him

  + Working with Niz, re: &quot;Infra&quot; on color block chart. Two parts...
  <br />
  1 When we're done w/mig, we still have debt
  <br />
  2 what does it mean that we're on h2o? Not on customer or product standpoint. The technology roadmap. RL has lead those before.&nbsp; Parallel to product roadmap.
  <br />
  <br />
  1 Product roadmap: has customer and prod
  <br />
  2 Technology roadmap: the platform. Needs CTO to guide it.&nbsp; Facilitation challenge of that. CTO: fixes, opportunities, backlog, etc.&nbsp; Knowing where it goes relative to the product teams.
  <br />
  3 Infrastructure: Syops, data center, etc.
  <br />
  <br />
  Niz is &quot;open to&quot; having conversation about it.

   - needing to meet with everyone and figure out what needs to change.&nbsp; Gotta get people who know things to talk to each other.
   <br />
   That's a hump of time requirements.&nbsp; Then, 3-5 months from now, not clear what kind of maintenance of the process is needed.
   <br />
   <br />
   RL did technology roadmap at Checkpoint, started by getting product manager (who were good) opinions. Then a monthly meeting. Then called experts in as they were needed.&nbsp; Then, the product managers completely changed their minds about what was needed.
   <br />
   <br />
   * Immediate challenge to figure out what they position would involved.
   <br />
   Who has to be on it? Who has to be socialized on it?
   <br />
   <br />
   * Should BH be at warp, should BH be there?

   <br />
   Add this CTO stuff to my plate, I have no more time.
   <br />
   When Platforms is more under control....
   <br />
   Between now and 4 months from now, think about this organization as a flow of opportunities;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think about how to get rudders on the rafts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Think of Ron as RL to find things , to socialize it with, find connections.
   <br />
   There are people who aren't Dir, who Dir look at as &quot;Thought leaders&quot; (sort of); I'm one of two of those, to be much more impactful. My interest in PMO is an example (pushed RL to say &quot;Why am I not&quot;; ) I want you to be impactful;
   <br />
   Leverage Ron, so I don't have to [utilize formal authority to horn in on things] ...
   <br />
   &quot;I see this problem, it seems to not be moving ahead, I'd like to move it ahead...&quot;

  1. to RL: tell me more about what I would be doing if I were a member of this team, but not running it

  <br />
  3. how to handle the resource crush
  <br />
  4. how working with Xenia
  <br />
  5. the list of members, only lb and adv are strong
  <br />
  6. what is the universe of problems? migrations+what; then what mix?
  <br />
  7. how to do the Project Management training?
  <br />
  8. what kind of outreach to ex. HW PMI people outside of the core group?
  <br />

  London update.. KFR, LP, Niz
  <br />
  <br />
  Niz twice presented
  <br />
  Jon, Helen, Esther, Ian
  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;It's a winnable account.&quot;&nbsp; They're in very deep with us.
  <br />
  <br />
  =&gt; KFR clearly is the executive sponsor in evil Ian's eyes.
  <br />
  =&gt; evil Ian does not want to work with John Sack.
  <br />
  <br />
  Jon thought he wanted APIs, but he wasn't clear why (see below, Niz doesn't want to do them w/o a forcing factor)
  <br />
  Jon wanted to Xquery&nbsp; Mark Logic directly. Not practical
  <br />
  <br />
  Helen K thinks we've shut only them out
  <br />
  In truth,&nbsp; we have stability, security, performance, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's those &quot;managerial&quot; aspects that make implementation a medium-sized project, rather than a smaller one
  <br />
  <br />
  * GIVE DANIEL the tools, he's great!&nbsp; He loved talking to Ian.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  re: the technical liaison role:
  <br />
  - evil Ian asked for it
  <br />
  - ? IB, RS, feed design etc
 -for questions like media types, header changes, etc
  <br />
  - first level filter
  <br />
  - Jon wants to talk Java to techies.
  <br />
  - Someone who has pull, can get things changed
  <br />
  - Don't want CTO, don't want message-taker
  <br />
  - at times their questions needs apps (IB),&nbsp; systems (JR, CJ) or Drupal (Niz) help.
  <br />
  <br />
  * Esther said Xenia was stellar
  <br />
  <br />
  * Niz would like to join some pre-executive meeting tech briefings, to get the techie-to-techie questions taken care of before evil Ian is in the room, for whom they all have to posture. For Jon, Daniel, Helen
  <br />
  <br />
  * Niz could do it, but he has inbound CTO role to manage (as well as pieces of high-level outbound CTO, which he likes)
  <br />
  * Niz would like to outsource lower priorities that we can't get to. revenue sharing to finance a tech intermediary position
  <br />
  <br />
  Need a tech rep who can go places w/PMs
  <br />
  <br />
  bmj.com redesign
  <br />
  - They are exploring basing it on Drupal. March target. Chrsitina has wireframes of what it might look like.
  <br />
  * Niz has promised we'd be able to deliver article content via a Drupal module.
  <br />
  - Jon wanted to avoid another in-house CMS (Plone, .., etc). So he was going to build a java framework. (!)
  <br />
  - Niz needs to get Drupal mobile, file manager moving so he's in a position to help bmj.com succeed.
  <br />
  <br />
  API
  <br />
  - make them define what &quot;API&quot; means. Jon is unclear.
  <br />
  ** Niz has a model in which we have a proxy interface to SASS, which pulls out our namespaced stuff, etc. But BMJ is concerned that we don't emaciate the content.
  <br />
  * data API, front by proxy is doable. But not trivial. (Performance, embargo, limit to access only BMJ content, etc). Proxy for SASS
  <br />
  <br />
  * Niz also things that RSS or atom feeds can serve a heck of a lot of this. Drupal is very facile w/RSS
  <br />
  <br />
  ** Niz thinks we could offer APIs for: Search, a/c, reporting and content.&nbsp; The last is what bmj.com needs
  <br />
  *** BMJ is doing their own a/c (!!)
  <br />
  - Nice is concerned that we don't do all the API definition work, and then have no one use it for years. Need forcing factor
  <br />
  <br />
  - Suggests we do a business requirements framework document, and also a skeletal or schematic &quot;spec&quot;. That way we'll be prepared. We'll have thought it through, and be ready to discuss.
  <br />
  <br />
  Drupal
  <br />
  * mobile, some filemanager.
  <br />
  ** &quot;It's an alternative&quot;

  - PMO process definition and implementation: intake, monitoring, updating, reporting, etc.&nbsp; MIS development,&nbsp; integration, etc
  <br />
  - representing the face of PMO within HW; thought leadership
  <br />
  <br />
  - relationship w/AdV as a PgM
  <br />
  <br />
  2) I realize now, this week that more time is needed than I originally anticipated for
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * investigation (of new projects)
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * mentoring (new employees, new assignees)
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * administrivia and other overhead

  other demands:
 - new biz cards

  TEAM LEAD QX:
  <br />
  1. title
  <br />
  2. tools (? scheduling? Project.net?)
  <br />
  3. how to do the global scheduling? vs &quot;When do you think we'll be free.&quot;
  <br />

  ======================
  <br />
  He had listed &quot;You also took on a role with BMJ as our &quot;Technical Manager&quot; of their account.&nbsp; (Removed)
  <br />
  <br />
  RL re Goals
  <br />
  * had been looking for management, proj mgmt, lean + agile
  <br />
  * not finding it. Lots of non-Agile apps. Agile w/o mgmt;&nbsp; Tien was strongest. Hire her has program manager,
  <font>
   and have BH act as team lead; RL would still be manager.
   <font>
    <br />
    <br />
    BH responsible for &quot;swirling the colors&quot;.
    <br />
    <br />
    Program vs Project management?
    <br />
    <b>
     <font>
      Like Angie has for Mig's.
     </font>
    </b>
    <font>
     <br />
     Tien would for bring lean and kanban. in.
     <br />
     <br />
     BH could be
     <font>
      program title or team lead title or ?? head of the PMO??
      <font>
       <br />
       Tien not prepared for managing group of 6 (although she's written that many reviews);&nbsp; @ agile project leaders meeting;&nbsp; More fundamental one is;
       <b>
        <font>
         matching of needs and project managers.
        </font>
       </b>
       <font>
        <br />
        If RL took BH role, keep Angie doing what she does.

   <br />
   <br />
   ron (Ron Lichty) posted the following content to the General forum:
   <br />
   <br />
   Summary:
   <br />
   On Wednesday, December 22, HighWire will initiate a site release process that will reduce the number of deployments by shifting all feature installs to a single change window each week. This is the site release process we announced in June. Feature installs will occur Wednesdays between 4-6pm Pacific Time. Java installs will be moved to the same Wednesday time to coincide. Production schedules, migrations and launches will be unaffected.
   <br />
   <br />
   What scheduled site deployments mean for you:
   <br />
   Your production schedule will be unaffected by this policy. New site launches and migrations will also be unaffected. Feature installation and site updates will now be done just once a week late afternoons on Wednesdays.&nbsp; Only sites requiring work will be affected by the weekly deployments.
   <br />
   <br />
   There will be some exceptions to weekly releases:
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work required for an embargoed issue to publish on time, and that cannot be scheduled ahead.
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical access issues preventing readers from accessing your content,
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feature releases that require a specific time and day and that cannot be scheduled ahead.
   <br />
   <br />
   Exceptions to the release schedule will be handled on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; Any work that is currently scheduled (that is, already has a specific release date) will not be affected.
   <br />
   <br />
   The vast majority of site work can and should be done in a planned and scheduled manner. We look to you to coordinate your business and technical needs with us as you have always done.
   <br />
   <br />
   Background:
   <br />
   This change was announced during our HighWire publisher meeting last June.* It was among a series of changes we described affecting our organizational structure, staff, and policies.
   <br />
   <br />
   What we announced then #0150; and are implementing now #0150; are regular site release windows. Sites that need to be updated will now be deployed during a scheduled weekly window rather than the previous array of ad hoc deployments.
   <br />
   <br />
   We are now in the process of implementing this strategy.&nbsp; On Wednesday, December 22, HighWire will begin scheduled weekly deployments during a weekly window on Wednesdays between 4-6pm Pacific Time.
   <br />
   <br />
   Benefits: Weekly scheduled deployments are more efficient &amp; will improve results:
   <br />
   Our goals for scheduled deployments are to improve our quality of work, increase productivity, and improve site stability as follows:
   <br />
   <br />
   Quality #0150; Weekly deployments allow for a more stable pattern of request, build, test, and deploy across our platform. This improves our work processes and the quality of output.&nbsp; It also increases the likelihood of discovering and addressing problems before they reach production.
   <br />
   <br />
   Productivity #0150; Weekly deployments save time. Our current ad hoc deployments take 40-60 hours per month. Fixing bugs triggered by the current ad hoc scheduling takes even more. That#0146;s time that can now be used for your site development.
   <br />
   <br />
   Stability #0150; Having fewer deployments reduces the downtime necessitated by site restarts. It also reduces load on servers, and the resulting risk of unintended outages.
   <br />
   <br />
   Best practices #0150; Because creating an even, steady development rhythm at a sustainable, constant pace itself reduces noise and improves predictability, quality and productivity, it has become an industry best practice.
   <br />
   <br />
   What Else - part of broader initiatives at HighWire to improve predictability and quality:
   <br />
   <br />
   Challenged by parallel demands for platform enhancements on top of migrating 1,400 journals and books to its new H2O platform, HighWire has been taking a series of initiatives this year to improve quality, efficiency, productivity, and predictability. In addition to scheduled deployments, they include:
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expanding QA both internally and with offshore resources
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increasing project management
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extending HighWire#0146;s use of QuickBase to be shared #0150; making it a collaborative tool you and we can use together
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initiating use of Agile methodologies
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creation of a Product Requirements Document to make it easier for you and us to #0147;get it right#0148; the first time
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adding additional depth to our post-project review process
   <br />
   #0149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking to you, when you have multiple requests, tasks or projects, to prioritize them
   <br />
   <br />
   Establishing a reliable pattern of request, build, test, and release will allow HighWire to build more reliable and professional services for you.
   <br />
   <br />
   We believe this strategy has clear benefits for your site management. We welcome your input and questions. Please send questions to your Publication Manager.
