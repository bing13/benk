* implement Django-native a/c, rather than apache at top level
* limit results to 200 items, w/option to show all
* hoist option
=> Basically, you want to be able to pass starting item, # of results to display, and view, and have the right thing happen. Probably means genralizing buildlist, so a big deal. But worth it.
* use includes in url.py - which can handle multiple applications - to make it more modular
* move all of benk under /pim1?
