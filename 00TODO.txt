NEW ========================================================

- if no hits, search errors

- search result display should *not* have action arrows.



+ PROBLEM. oNLY SAFE way to add items is from the interface. Awkward for adding first items in new projects


+ I think one problem is that once imported, adding the first item to the next project

  is hard, b/c when I do it by hand, it's easy to link it wrongly.


- concern that adding items is busted, at least after an import. 

* implement Django-native a/c, rather than apache at top level
* limit results to 200 items, w/option to show all
* use includes in url.py - which can handle multiple applications - to make it more modular
* move all of benk under /pim1?
=========================
displayList = buildDisplayList(current_projs,'0','-date_gootask_display')
    
def buildDisplayList(projectx, projID, ordering):
   
projectx - not used
projID 0 if "all", otherwise a project__id
ordering "follows" (i.e., outline, w/indents)  // often pSort as passed



MISC =======================================================
- catch phrase: "What do you think?"

- Load serious data


QUESTIONS =======================================================

a. Hoist is huge.

   - Display rule: If an item is hoisted, that's your organizing principle. Otherwise, so first N items.

   - Offer to hoist me or my parent

   - Hoist may require significant rewrite of buildlist.


b. how to limit display to reasonable # of items?

c. What is a "project" from Infoselect import? "PMO", or "PMO/CHOICE"? Handwork?

d. beware IS import w/HTML in titles, etc

e. how to search?  search result as regular flat list? then a search result item could be hoisted in an outline view



MODELING ================================================

++. IMPORT WON'T WORK PAST FIRST LOADING, unless before the second run, you delete or reformat all the IS_import_IDs. That's because thay are only unique for each IS HTML export.


   


BUGS ============================================================
+ check for intelligent deletions
- moving up past top problematic (parent/follow corruption)
- reformat app links on the admin interface [very odd, tried unsuccessfully]
- add logical page titles


DESIGN====================================================================


+ Browse Levels: (1) project list, (2) all items in a project, (3) hoisted list

* Bread crumbs: show item, parent, parent's parent, etc.


MAJOR NEW MODE: Grid view


+  Grid mode improves on the misused model of gooTasks imposed above
   calendar days. Rarely are those actual day to-do's.  Within each
   cell, tasks that can be reordered simply by dragging. fastest
   cross-project scanning possible, with one-click item adding.


+ build JS outline view (dynamic, popup, draggable)
- It would be more flexible to redesign buildlist such that it accepted a list of
  objects or ids. Right now it operates on the entire item collection only.  
  it would be easier to reuse its code if the calling routine provided a list of
  objects or ids (buildlist could still default to showing all..)
- decide handling of Actions vis-a-vis Projects (ex., can cross boundaries or not, etc)


? make status, priority optional? (or default them?)
+ improve data entry, esp. adding a new item - shouldn't have to go to project edit screen to add the item to a project there.
+ check out the "inline admin" model, which lets you edit models on the same page as a parent model. These are called "inlines"

POSIT:  moves up and down *only* happen with relation to your peers, and are bounded by your peer group. Children always follow.


* imports, etc in library probably need review


* need to set up system path, etc, so the library can be found by the views.py file



==========================================
DONE
DB MODS TO MAKE NEXT:
.0. blank=TRUE on goodate HTMLnoteBody
.0. make the google calendar date optional
.0. position & parent parameters
.+ change "date_create" to "date_created"
. + Date created, date modified should be automatically generated (please!)
. on page list, move Project from a column, to a row divider.
,+ add buttons for adding an item, and moving an item
.+ add views by hierarchy (.outline) | date | priority | status
.+ would like note hiding widget to only appear if the item has a text note, otherwise not.
.+ move sidebar to top, w/pulldown menu (forms) (??multiple selection??) [time to accept project should be one-to-many, and modify the forms]
.- change list item li bullet to vary if an item is a parent
.! save project in git. 
.- moveup needs to take children with it-
.- movedown: truncates if you try to move parent1 with kids down past parent2 with kids (p2 happened to be the last parent)
.-. movedown: crash if you try to move last parent (w/kids) down (no corruption)
. Update tasks rather global upload. Need to track which items are which. 
  	 - post a parseable benk ID into gtasks
	 - when you post a gTask, you get back a gID. Stash the gID in a dedicated gID field. 
  already exists, and create any task that doesn't. 
  Note that this REQUIRES that we add a GOOGLEID field to the model. :-p
.x- move up pulls kids along, and move down abandons them
.- Move down can corrupt the first item in list ([0,0]->[0,1])
- promoting: does not promote children

.* hoist option
. Basically, you want to be able to pass starting item, # of results to display, and view, and have the right thing happen. Probably means genralizing buildlist, so a big deal. But worth it.
. fix logging - write to dx.*.* log file, not bh.com. AND OPEN as APPEND .seem to be losing history.
